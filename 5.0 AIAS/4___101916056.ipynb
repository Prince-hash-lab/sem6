       "  'ld tell you, the friend that was driving me was black, which really doesnt have anything to do with the story other than to let you know there was fear in the car. not my fear. im black, but im also dave chappelle. so, i figured, you know, shit will probably be fine. traffic stop started off on the right foot. the cops came up to the drivers side. hi. how are you guys doing tonight? and he recognized me immediately. oh. dave chappelle. and i looked at my friend like, were getting out of this shit. and then he says, you guys were swerving in the lane. do you mind just stepping out of the car for a second? still no cause for alarm. i looked through the rearview mirror. the body language of the arrest looked good. just talking. so, then i started fucking with the radio. you know a traffic stop is going good if youre listening to the radio when someone else is outside of the car. but then, when i looked back in the rearview mirror, something had gone horribly wrong. that motherfucker was back there like and the next thing i knew, they were stuffing him in the back of the car, and i thought what anybody would think in a situation like that: oh, my god. what is gonna happen to me? and the police walked up to the window. mr. chappelle, we had to arrest your friend. he refused to take our breathalyzer test. i said, that motherfucker. not complying? thats odd. so, officer, whats gonna happen to me? youre fine. were just gonna have to ask you to step out of the car so we can impound the vehicle, and well arrange for you to have a ride home. i said, oh, well, no. i would rather you just give me the keys. he said, mr. chappelle, your friend already told us hes your designated driver. we cant let you drive in this condition. i was like, no, n i g g a, im good. and then suddenly, the shit turned into vegas. he was like ill let you blow for it. i said, excuse me? he said, if you blow in my breathalyzer– i said, oh, n i g g a, i thought you was trying to get your dick sucked. whats the– whew! whew! if you blow in my breathalyzer and pass, ill give you the keys to the car. i said, uh set em up, n i g g a. lets play. and i blew in that thing. and it made a noise. beep! i said, uh-oh. and he looked at it. he said, oh, well, mr. chappelle, i guess youre free to go. i said, i am? i didnt know that thing didnt pick up weed. i drove home on the miles an hour. yeah, it all worked out. it all worked out. im one of the lucky ones. it doesnt work out that well for everybody. i saw that videotape of that lady that got beat up in la in traffic. you see that shit on rush hour traffic? they beat a black womans ass. this woman didnt even do anything wrong. its fucked up. it was so fucked up, it didnt even go to court. the city of l.a. just gave that woman $. million for her pain and suffering. that is not bad, considering thats the same amount of money that marcos maidana made to fight floyd mayweather the second time. and this woman obviously hasnt trained a day in her life. you can see it on the tape. she didnt come to fight. her guards were low. she was taking a lot of shots. everybodys mad at police now. i watched that– you see that shit on netflix, making a murderer? the steven avery story. if you havent seen it, check it out. steven avery is in more trouble than any white person in the history of the united states has ever been in! in a justice system designed for him to thrive, hes failed miserably twice. i cant even wrap my mind around it. if making a murderer was about a black dude, that shit would be called duh! of course everything would go wrong. seems like he did it, all right. the motherfucker even had $, for his legal defense. that should get you off in wisconsin. thats like oj money. all he needed to get off that he didnt have was a single black juror. thats all it wouldve took. because only a black dude in the united states can look at other dudes and be like, i think the police did this shit. hes fucked up in the game. thats how oj got off. ive been watching that new oj show. i cant get enough of that shit. doesnt it bring back good memories? but i forgot just how polarizing that oj case was. and you know, ive met oj simpson on four different occasions in my life. and before the end of the show, i will tell you about each of those occasions. the first time i met oj simpson, i was in santa monica. -santa monica! -yeah! i cant believe a black dude was like, santa monica! you the last n i g g a i would expect to say that. let me see your shoes. you got some vans on, n i g g a? what you got? santa monica! you? at the time, i was . i had done a show, and the guy from the club came up and was like, hey, oj simpsons here, and he said he wants to meet you. i said, what? fuck yeah! i ran down the steps, and oj ',\n",
       "  'was down there. hes like, hey, young man. how are you? its very good to meet you. and youre doing really good work, and i hope good things happen for you in your life. i was like, man, thanks, mr. juice. standing beside him, was– i dont know the nice way to say this– his soon-to-be-slain wife. ladies and gentlemen, man the fuck up, or youre not gonna make it to the end of this show. just man the fuck up. shes dead. we already know what happened. we dont know who did it, but we know what happened. i should tell you, that woman was very nice to me. she actually embraced me. she said, i think youre adorable, and she hugged me. she goes, good luck to you, and she held me for a long time. and i whispered in her ear, bitch, are you trying to get us both killed? im just kidding. i didnt say that, but that was the first time, in a nutshell. its good to see so many so many different people here from so many different ethnicities. very diverse crowd. looks like you thought bernie sanders was gonna come out in this motherfucker. but surprise! its me. yeah. yeah, you know, im happy, really, to see black people come. a lot of black people dont fuck with me like they used to. but theres a few reasons you dont see black people at my shows. one is because, obviously, black people have slower internet connections. i mean, that would be my guess. i dont know what– actually, my own actions drew a wedge between me and the community i hold so dear. a couple of weeks ago, i was supposed to be in flint, michigan, for a charity benefit that was supposed to raise awareness for the appalling condition of the water in flint. i dont know if you know this, but the water in flint is fucking poisonous. its actually making people sick. hollywood people are like, so what? at least they have water. but this water– this water is fucked up. so, a lot of black celebrities flew into flint, and they did a tremendous charity benefit, and i was on the schedule to appear. uh so, the reason a lot of people havent heard about this benefit– it was the same day as the oscars. right, i know. so, i was on my way to the airport to go to flint, and then chris rock calls me and is like, hey, dave, i got a ticket for you for the oscars. can you make it? and i was like, sure, n i g g a. im on my way to the airport right now. come on, man. what am i gonna do about that water? what am i, a fucking superhero? i need to have fun. i need to live, too! i didnt fuck that water up! stevie wonder was there. they didnt need me. im sorry, everybody. id never been to the oscars. youve seen the movies i make. i was excited. i knew i was gonna get into some trouble, because when i was walking on the red carpet, the black press came after me. excuse me, brother. when you hear somebody call you brother too much, something terrible is about to happen. excuse me, brother. brother? and i looked back, and the motherfucker had a tuxedo with the kente cloth tie. i said, uh-oh. he said, i just want to ask you a couple questions. i said, what publication are you with? he said, me? im with the daily bongo. i said, daily bongo? what the fuck? who the fuck reads this? he said, listen, brother, i just want to ask you a quick question. you understand that this year, this is a boycott for the oscars. so, im just wondering what made you, of all people, cross the motherfucking picket line and be here tonight. i said, boycott? n i g g a, i havent been working in ten years. what do you mean, boycott? ive been on strike. yall n i g g a s didnt stop working. i had to watch fucking key and peele do my show every night! so, fuck the daily bongo, is what i said. i went to the oscars and had a wonderful time. i went in that fucking green room. it was filled with so many stars, i couldnt even believe what i was seeing. hollywood was seducing me all over again. i was sitting back there. im smoking, drinking with the stars. and then two hollywood movie producers came over, right to me. oh, my god. dave chappelle, said the leader one. he was obviously gay. some guys, you can just tell. the other one seemed like a money guy. maybe he was from texas or some shit. but the gay one was definitely the leader because he did all the talking. and then he hit me with: so, david, um do you have any movie ideas that you would like to pursue? the truth is, i dont. but if you know the game, youre not supposed to tell motherfuckers you dont have ideas. i was like, yeah, man. i got plenty of ideas. and he called my bluff. really? like what? huh? oh. um um and then i just started making up shit that i thought maybe hed like to see. i said, i have a superhero idea. he goes, really? i go, yeah. hes a– hes a gay superhero. he was like, really?! whats it called? huh? oh, its called– its called same hero,',\n",
       "  ' new boots. its about a gay sous-chef in san francisco that gets bit by a radioactive rat on his shift when hes taking out the trash and is blessed with powers beyond his wildest dreams, supersonic gay kind of powers. and he starts saving everybody in san francisco. but at first, he only saves gay people. later, he saves everybody, and the whole city just falls in love with him. the only problem is, no one remembers him when he saves them. well, i dont understand. why wouldnt they remember him? i said, because, dummy, hes gay. he keeps changing his outfit. people come up– thanks for saving me, sir. whats your name anyway? hes like, same hero, new boots! and that motherfucker flies away. he was like, i like it a lot. the texan didnt like that shit at all. he was upset. thats impossible, a gay superhero. i said, what? well, i have others. i have a superhero youd love, cause hes stronger than superman and he fights for truth, justice and the american way, like superman, but more than superman. he beats up mexicans for no reason. the texans like, you got my attention. im like, man, this motherfuckers so strong, he can fly and do all this great shit. only problem with this guy is he cant even activate his powers unless he touches– unless he touches a womans vagina. not a long touch, just a couple of pats. he said, well, whats the problem with that? i said, the problem, sir, is that our hero is not a handsome man. and hes often short on cash. so, whenever trouble breaks out, he has to run around the city and convince women to let him pat their vaginas. please, miss! that buildings on fire. can i pat your vagina? quickly. people are dying! but he cant tell them exactly why. eww! get away! youre gross! please, miss! people are dying! just a couple of pats! eww! gross! get away! so, he rapes them. i know, i know. thats the dilemma for the audience. because he rapes, but he saves a lot of lives. and he saves way more than he rapes, and he only rapes to save. but he does rape. i didnt realize it, but the whole green room was looking at us. all the celebrities were disgusted. ohh. that guy from texas was like, heres my card. call me on monday. that worked out. the second time i met oj simpson. it was right after the trial of the century. there i was, now a young man of probably . oj simpson was the most famous, or infamous, face on planet earth. i was in a restaurant in beverly hills with my agents. i wasnt alone in the restaurant, but i was alone. i was the only black person in the restaurant. and in the s, that felt very uncomfortable. now i tend to enjoy it at this age. i was having dinner with my agents, celebrating a deal that they told me was lucrative, but i later learned fucking sucked. and suddenly, a group of women walked by. every race was in that group. black, white, asian, latina, white, white and white again. they were all gorgeous. i watched them walk by. then i saw a familiar face. al cowlings, the man from the infamous bronco chase, walked by and embraced one of the women, and they walked towards the door. couldnt believe what i saw. and then, close behind him, was oj simpson, newly released from jail. the restaurant fell still. i was shocked. i didnt mean to say it out loud, but it just came out. oj! he stopped, turned around to see who said it, saw my black face and correctly assumed it was me. i was sitting in the corner of the booth. he leaned over all the white people i was having dinner with and shook my hand. how are you, young man? he looked in my eyes, and i could see in his eyes that he didnt remember meeting me the first time. and then he walked away. and i looked back at my agents, and all of them had nothing short of disgust on their faces. and the only one with the courage to voice their disgust was a woman named sharon who used to represent me. how could you? she said. how could you shake hands with that murderer? i said, sharon, with all due respect, that murderer ran for over , yards. and he was acquitted. so, you know, fuck it. the glove didnt fit. the glove didnt fit. get over yourself. some people cant do that. some people just cant get over themselves. gay people have a hard time doing that recently. here we go. here comes the deep water. no, recently ive noticed that. i noticed it with that manny pacquiao controversy. yeah, it was– now, in the gay communitys defense, manny pacquiao said some outlandish shit about gay people, very not nice things that i wont repeat, but there was biblical verses and some analogies to animals. it wasnt a good look. nike took his shoes immediately. which i thought was a little harsh. a little harsh, you know what i mean? just cause hes asian. you know what i mean? how the fuck are you gonna take the shoes off an asian dude to appea',\n",
       "  'se a gay dude? you know what i mean? no? you dont know what i mean. but asian people kind of know what i mean. no? no asians in the front? no? no, this is what i mean. look, youre an asian dude– i say this with no disrespect. were all americans, right? and we can agree that america has a huge body count all over the world, but nowhere more than asia. literally, if you look at history, recently, we have bombed the masculinity out of an entire continent. we dropped two atomic bombs on fucking japan, and theyve been drawing hello kitty and shit ever since. theres a lot of lady-boys in the wake of our bombs. and i know these things because my wife is asian. shes filipino. all right, okay. so, that explains it. now you know why you see me at all those filipino events. im not there picking up pussy. im dropping some off. i take my wife to all that shit. i took my wife to see pacquiao fight mayweather. we sat ringside, okay? that– yeah, that was a quiet car ride home, thats what that was. but if you know whats popping in the philippines, you know that they got a whole generation of kids in the philippines growing up without their mothers. yes. a lot of women in the philippines go to the arabian peninsula, they come to the united states, they make all their money here, they send all that money back home, which is still one of the number-one staples in the philippines economy– money that the expats send back to the philippines. the men, on the other hand, are left rearing children, twiddling their thumbs, waiting on their wives checks. these men have been fucking emasculated. and then suddenly, a boxer rises from amongst them and reinstates their manhood with his motherfucking fist. this is not the guy youre supposed to ask, what do you think of homosexuals? hes not your champ. shit. thats why i dont have a sneaker deal, cause if you say something that people dont like, theyll take your fucking shoes off. if martin luther king had a sneaker deal, wed still be on the back of the bus. its true. the nike exec would come up– hi, martin. uh we need you to tone down the talk of civil rights and blacks being humans. its upsetting our southern distributors. but i dont understand. i thought thats why i had a sneaker deal in the first place. not quite. really, its a walking shoe. and we like the marching, but try to understand. fuck that shit. you know, i get it, though. i understand why gay people are mad, and i empathize. you know what? im just telling you this as a black dude. i support your movement. but if you want to take some advice from a negro, pace yourself. these things take a while. just cause they passed the law doesnt mean theyre gonna like it. brown v. board of education was in. somebody called me a n i g g e r in traffic last wednesday. it takes a minute. my wifes friend stewart told me that. my wife has a lot of gay friends. stewarts their leader. she has a lot of gay friends. and i dont like em. not cause theyre gay. im just judging them on the merits of their character. theyre just not nice dudes. theyre fucking rude houseguests. theyre sitting on my couch, giggling with my wife, eating my motherfucking macaroons. then i come in, and they act like the partys over. hey, stewart. whats going on? this guy talks to me the way a cat would speak if a cat could talk. hi, david. stewart, whats all the beef, man? whats going– he always wants to have some kind of gay political argument. the last one was about a petition in federal court to take the words husband and wife out of the law. i said, why would you want those words out of the law? he said, because it discriminates against same-sex couples. i was like, n i g g a s, please, save me the semantics. just trust me. take your chips and get the fuck out of the casino. youre about to crap out! just go outside, talk that over amongst yourselves, and whichever one of you is gayer, thats the wife. no, no. stewart didnt like that. stewart educates me about this movement. i didnt even know shit about it. he told me its called lbgtq! i was like, what the fuck is the q? does that even make sense? q? turns out q is like the vowels. that shit is sometimes y. its for gay dudes that dont really know theyre gay. like prison fags who are like, what? im not gay, n i g g a. im just sucking these dicks to pass the time. im not g. im q. ugh. i think– okay, again, of all those letters, the t has the toughest road ahead. in fact, i think the t should stand for tough road ahead. theyve got the longest mental gap to bridge. thats all im saying. because whenever i see one of them ts on the street, i dont mind them, but ill be like, man, i miss bruce. im sorry, guys. im . i remember bruce jenner. before the kardashians, before all that, this motherfucker was a white ame',\n",
       "  'rican superhero. it was amazing. he was beating africans at track and field. wed never seen anything like it. he was on my cereal box growing up. you know how much of that cereal i ate? n i g g a, i didnt know he was gonna do that. i knew before you guys knew. i heard things on the street in hollywood. youd just be out, see people. hey, whats up, kanye? why the long face? n i g g a, youll see. i got two mother-in-laws now. and when i heard he was gonna do it, i was scared. i didnt think the public was ready. i didnt think the media was ready. and you know what? i was wrong. not only did the public embrace him, but the media was nice. id never seen anything like it. welcome to the world, caitlyn. so long, bruce. hello, caitlyn. i was shocked! is this happening? wait a minute. is this a time in american history where an american can make a decision for themselves, and even though other americans dont understand it, theyll support it and let this person live a happy life? is this whats happening? if it is, then good for america. thats dave chappelle, the american. although, dave chappelle, the black american, he was a little jealous. i was like, how the fuck are transgender people beating black people in the discrimination olympics? if the police shot half as many transgenders as they did n i g g a s last year, thered be a fucking war in la. i know black dudes in brooklyn– hard street motherfuckers– that wear high heels just to feel safe. transgenders are gangsters. i used to do business with a transgender in hollywood. man, everybody would be scared of her in the boardroom. shed walk in there, newly-minted woman, high heels, purse. wouldnt say anything to us, just walk around the conference table, looking mean and shit. then shed walk to the head of the conference table, stare at us all, reach in her purse, pull her old dick out and throw it on the table. lets talk business, gentlemen. aaah! shit is scary as fuck. if your best friend pitched that to you, youd be horrified. yo, n i g g a, lets go to the hospital and cut our dicks off and make pussies out of them shits. what?! cant we just get matching jackets or tattoos or something? you sure thats what you want to do? theres only way to find out, n i g g a. wu-tang! pow! pow! lets go to the club and trick n i g g a s into fucking us. yeah. the third time i met oj simpson— the third time i met oj simpson, i was doing great in life. id just finished the second season of chappelles show. man, those were good days. i was playing a comedy club in miami, the improv. i dont know if youve ever been, but if you have, youd know the door for the green room is right on the stage. can you imagine such a thing? if i walked out of the door of the green room, bam, i was right here, right from the dressing room. and i did that. i walked out, and the whole crowd was like, hooray! and i looked– maam, as close as you are to me– i saw him as soon as i came out: the juice. and i saw recognition in his eyes, and it filled me with pride that he knew who i was. i didnt acknowledge his presence because it was a white audience, and i didnt want to start a panic. but i did my show. the show went great. i said, good night, everyone. they all said, yay! and i didnt say nothing to oj, but i just gave him the signal to let him know i knew he was there. and i walked into the green room, and oj was already in there! i was like, how the fuck is this possible? i was scared. and then my friends came in, and we all started talking. we sat down on the couch. and im just telling you what i saw with my own eyes. you can believe me or not believe me. but in my experience, oj simpson– one of the nicest men id ever met. he was nice to me. he was nice to my friends. the conversation was filled with warmth and levity, humor and wisdom. we talked for minutes, and then suddenly, the juice said, you know what? ive got to be going. but its good to see you again, and im glad things went so well. i said, thanks, juice. and my friends said, yeah, goodbye, mr. juice. they were new to the game. he said, no. thank you for your hospitality. good night, guys. and we said, good night. and he just walked out of the room. and as soon as the door closed, we all looked at each other like, that n i g g a did that shit. did you feel that? i could feel like murder in the room. well, you young heads missed that shit. youre all too young. you dont remember that. -how old are you, young, man? you. -twenty-four. twenty-four? you dont know shit. you dont know shit! you gotta google shit that i lived through. see, this is why i lock motherfuckers phones up. seriously. because the young kids, you guys need to take a break from that– we all need to break just from that technology, just for a minute. you know, im ',\n",
       "  'from a different time, young man. a dark time to you. im from a time that i didnt even used to know who was on the phone until i answered the shit. like, when tragedy used to strike. i remember i was  years old, and the teacher wheeled a television set into the classroom. you remember these days? and she turned it on to one of three channels. and she said, class, the space shuttle is taking off, and were all gonna watch it take off. man, that shit was going great for like, three to five minutes. thats right. you remember. it fucking exploded! right on television. everybody on board, dead. immediately presumed dead. it was so bad, the teacher looked at all the kids and was like you can go home. it was a goddamn national tragedy. this was cold war america. the russians were laughing at us. my point is, for a guy your age wouldnt even know the pain, because in your generation, its like the space shuttle blows up every fucking day. how can you care about anything when you know every goddamn thing? im getting over one cop shooting, and then another one happens, and then another one happens, and another one happens. im crying about paris, and then brussels happens. i cant keep track of all this shit. so you just give the fuck up. thats the hallmark of your generation, and thats fucked up, because your generation lives in the most difficult time in human history. this is the age of spin. the age where nobody knows what the fuck theyre even looking at. did you know that planned parenthood was for abortions? its for people that dont plan things out at all. thats right. so, a guy your age doesnt really know how he feels. are you pro-choice? are you anti-consequences? what does it all really mean? its easier not to care for you. but for us, we were trained to care. we were raised that way. i used to watch a fucking cartoon when i was growing up called care bears. it was about a fucking group of teddy-bear people. they were like teddy bears, but they were like people, and they were all different colors, and they all fucking just walked around, caring. they cared about each other and everything else. they all had different designs on their stomachs, and the designs told you something about what they might be like inside. very, very loving group of beings. and when shit got real bad, as nice as those teddy bears were, they didnt get mean faces. they got determined. hmm! and the leader would say, come on, guys. its time for the care bear stare! remember that shit? and them little teddy bears would lock arms and stare at the problem– and im not even bullshitting– actual love would shoot out of their chests and would dispel anything that was fucked up. and when we grew up, we wanted to be like those bears. and then we got our hearts broken, because we found out that life wasnt gonna let us do that and that its impossible to shoot love out of your chest. however, i have shot love onto somebodys chest before. i do it all the time. its the next best thing. you kids dont know. your generation is just determined to be angry, mad. everybodys mad. back when we were growing up, only black people were mad. now everybodys just trying to get in on the act. i try to think to myself, when did everyone get mad? and then i realize this happened before we were born. this is a long way to go, but it probably started in the second world war. think about it. all these black men, millions of black men, leave the united states for the first time, go over to europe with americas armed forces and fight the nazis and make more money fighting nazis than they ever dreamed they would make in the united states. and a lot of those men, while they were in europe– just to be real, not to be crass– a lot of them probably got their dicks sucked by white women. im sorry, ladies and gentlemen. this was world war ii europe, and these were desperate times, and penises were being sucked for shoelaces and chocolate and very frivolous things. and its very hard to come back to america and sit on the back of the bus after youve been in the south of france, getting your dick sucked for a crunch bar or some crazy shit like that. thats a life-changing experience. and while that was happening in europe, here in america, for the first time, women entered the workforce en masse, by the millions. all the men were gone. someone had to run the factory. the ladies did it. thats right. this was the first generation of american women to have independent income en masse, and when the men came back, the women werent the same. american women had grown. they were uttering phrases that no woman on earth had ever spoken before, things like, no and shut the fuck up and i dont feel like it. and then behind the scenes of that, there was a little-known government agen',\n",
       "  'cy that started testing mind control drugs on the american public. they fucked up. they tested it for  years. they didnt realize these drugs were not mind-controlling. they were mind-expanding. it was lsd and mescaline and shit like that. and for the first time, there was a new school of thought that was chemically induced that made people question the very society they lived in. by , the president of the united states was only  years old. can you imagine? dmx is older than that. and he was gonna usher in a new era of peace. he was gonna avoid the cold war. he was gonna end segregation. and they blew his fucking brains out in front of everyone in dallas. this country was never the same. there were seven more major assassinations in the . anyone that stood up and said anything was shot down in the streets like a fucking dog. kennedy, kennedy, king, x, evers, on and on. you didnt even have to be famous. you could be a college student at kent state, or in mississippi, protesting the vietnam war, and they shot them, too. the  were a wild era. and while all this was going on bill cosby raped  people. holy shit. thats a lot of rapes, man. this guys putting up real numbers. hes like the steph curry of rape. man, thats a lot of rapes. fifty-four? if he had raped less people thats still two dozen rapes! dont forget, each one of these rapes has eight hours of sleep in it. ladies and gentlemen, thats over hours of rape. it only takes hours to get a pilots license. if rapes were aircrafts, this n i g g a is top gun for sure. yeah, thats a tough one. and i was onstage not too long ago. i was in syracuse, new york. yeah. well, yeah, for syracuse. but the show didnt go so good all because i was talking about bill cosby a little bit. not a little bit. ill be honest. i talked about him for like, minutes. and a woman stood up in the back of the room, and she screamed out, you are a fucking asshole for saying these things! i know. instantly, i felt bad. not bad about what i was saying. i just felt bad like, oh, thats too bad she doesnt like the show. i didnt realize it at first, but not only did she say that, she was rushing the stage. by the time i saw her, i just saw this shadowy figure fucking charging up the aisle towards me in full fight mode. i was horrified. i said, oh, my god! im gonna kick this bitch in the face. lucky for me, i didnt have to. security tackled her. but it was a really fucking horrifying scene. a scuffle ensued. and then, finally, she screamed out to me, women suffer! i said, i know. and, ladies, i need you to know that i know. i need you to know. seriously, theres a lot of men in this room that identify themselves as feminists. i would include myself in that. dont ever forget, we all have mothers and daughters and sisters and wives, and we want to see all these women do well and not be held back by their gender. theres a lot of men like that in this room. theres a lot of men like that in the world. or as we are known on the streets, bitch-ass n i g g a s. but as this woman was wrestling and screaming at me, i started to take offense. and ill be honest, race was involved. she was a young white woman. well-intentioned, but just not thinking it all the way through. bitch, how the fuck are you going to yell at a black man about discrimination? she didnt get it. she just kept going. women suffer! i know. women suffer! same team. women suffer! i know. and this is when she went too far: we suffer just like you. slow your roll, bitch. you suffer, yes, but not like me. not like us. she goes, suffering is suffering. whats the difference? i said, come on, white woman, you know what it is. you was in on the heist. you just dont like your cut. you suffer, i suffer. you suffer, i suffer. thats how it works. cant do comparative suffering. if youre hungry, and your friend says, you know, people are starving in africa, so what, n i g g a? i still want lunch. black people know about comparative suffering, and you know that its a fucking dead-end game. blacks and jews do that shit to each other all the time. you ever played who suffered more with a jewish person? its a tough game. whenever you think youve got the jewish guy on the ropes, that motherfucker will be like, well, dont forget about egypt. egypt?! god damn, n i g g a, i didnt know we was going all the way back to egypt. what the fuck is wrong with her? what does she think? does she think that i dont know that rape is wrong? does she think that maybe i dont have empathy for bill cosbys alleged victims? and i would be remiss if i didnt remind you that technically these are all still allegations. although, i admit it looks very bad. perhaps if she looked at it correctly, she would have empathy for me, the man she was attacking, a -year-old bla',\n",
       "  'ck comedian. obviously, bill cosby was a hero to me. and she doesnt know what it feels like to think that your hero mightve done something so heinous, my god, you cant imagine. itd be as if you heard that chocolate ice cream itself had raped  people. youd say to yourself, oh, man, but i like chocolate ice cream. i dont want it to rape. didnt want to believe it. at first, i didnt believe it. i said, these people are obviously trying to destroy dr. cosbys rich legacy. even  allegations into it, i was still like, man he probably only raped ten or  of those people. i know, i know. but its really tough. you guys are young. imagine if you found out  years from now that kevin hart raped  people. youd be like, oh, my god. the only one that would believe that would be katt williams. hed be like, i knew that motherfucker was up to something! i knew kevin had raped those people. you know, i was mad at kevin, too, though. you know why? okay, first of all, i didnt even know kevin was as successful as he was. i found that shit out the hard way. i was at home when my son busted in. he said, dad, i need $. hes only years old, so i freaked out. whats going on, n i g g a? is somebody trying to kill you? he said, no, no. kevin harts coming to town, and i wanted to see his show. i said, how much are the tickets? he said, theyre $. i said, god damn! mine are only . i said, why do you need $, then? he goes, because i want to go with you, dad. please? and there it is. so, i took him to the show. and we go, we sit right up front. the lights go down, and one opening act after another goes on. then kevin takes the stage. the crowd goes fucking nuts. thousands of people. i was furious. the longer the show went on, the madder i got. because his show was fucking outstanding. it was maddening. these people were fucking holding their stomachs. my son was slapping his knee. im like, damn, n i g g a, i do this, too. kevin says, good night. the crowd goes crazy. and then everyone starts walking to his door, and the lights come on, and then my son is just standing there, looking at an empty stage. people are pushing past me, and nobodys recognizing me. im like, man, this place fucking sucks! i said, come on, son, lets get out of here. then my son looks back at me and says, dad, please. please, i have to meet him. i was like, oh, my god. so, i took him backstage. ive known kevin for years, but can you believe i was scared to knock on his dressing room door? i almost said son, i havent seen him for a long time. and one of kevins goons opened the door. hey, whats up, dave chappelle? what are you doing, man? its good to see you, brother. what are you doing in this area? this is a terrible area. im like, actually, i live around here. listen is kevin here? my son just wanted to meet him real quick. i dont know, cause kevins about to eat dinner. just then, kevin came around the corner to see who it was. what? oh, shit! whats up, dave? come on back. i was just about to have dinner. i dont know if you guys ate, but youre welcome to join me if youd like. and then my son pushed passed me. it was some cold shit. he goes, actually, mr. hart, we havent eaten in several hours. man, kevin took us into his back room. this guy had a fucking spread. it was tuesday night. this motherfucker was having sunday dinner. there were steaks, chops, corn with butter all over it. my son was eating all fast, embarrassing me. i was like, slow down, son. he was like then i looked over in the corner, and there was a box of custom-made jerseys for the local team. each one was hand-stitched, and on the back, they stitched on k-hart on all of them. kevin saw me staring at that box, and he went over and grabbed one of them jerseys, and he walked right to my son. he said, hey, little man. i want you to have this. and my son was like, thanks, mr. hart. this is when i got mad. he goes, if your father ever makes you mad, put that on. and he walked out. oh, that was some cold shit. then i realized– i looked up what kevin made on google. i couldnt believe that shit. kevin is the first comedian that a drake song could be about. kevin could walk around his house and sing all me, and the whole song would still be true. ♪ got everything, i got everything ♪\\n♪ i cannot complain, i cannot ♪\\n♪ i dont even know how much i really made ♪\\n♪ i forgot, its a lot ♪\\n♪ fuck that, never mind what i got ♪ and his wife will be like, kevin, come to bed! hell be like ♪ ho, shut the fuck up ♪ ♪ i got way too much– ♪ you know how much money you have to have to tell a girl to shut the fuck up? i have quiet, please money at best. id have to take a loan out for shut the fuck up. shut the fuck up– thats jay z money. and beyoncé got no, you shut the fuck up money. lets not forget. lets not forg',\n",
       "  'et. ive never met bill cosby, so im not defending him. lets just remember that he has a valuable legacy that i cant just throw away. i remember that hes the first black man to ever win an emmy in television. i also remember that hes the first guy to make a cartoon with black characters where their lips and noses were drawn proportionately. i remember that he had a television show that got numbers equivalent to the super bowl every thursday night. and i remember that he partnered up with a clinical psychologist to make sure that there was not one negative image of african-americans on his show. im telling you, thats no small thing. ive had a television show. i wouldnt have done that shit. he gave tens of millions of dollars to african-american institutions of higher learning, and is directly responsible for thousands of black kids going to college. not just the ones he raped. here comes the kicker. you ready? heres the fact that i heard, but havent confirmed. i heard that when martin luther king stood on the steps of the lincoln memorial and said he had a dream, he was speaking into a pa system that bill cosby paid for. so, you understand what im saying? the point is this: he rapes, but he saves. and he saves more than he rapes. but he probably does rape. thank you very much! good night! ♪ ah-ah, ah-ah ♪\\n♪ in every ghetto ♪\\n♪ ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah ♪\\n♪ in every ghetto ♪\\n♪ ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah ♪\\n♪ in every ghetto ♪\\n♪ ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah ♪ ♪ in every ghetto ♪ wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! i forgot. the fourth time i met oj simpson. the fourth time is not the funniest time, but it was the last time id see the juice. for some reason, i was at the kentucky derby. its a very long story. this is right after i quit chappelles show in spectacular fashion. there was a party hosted by michael jordan, and every athlete ive ever admired was in that room. yes. and then i saw a familiar face by the bar, standing there, drinking alone. it was chris tucker. now you have to remember, at this time, we were both technically missing. and we went over, and were talking with one another, and motherfuckers were amazed to see us together. seeing me and chris tucker at that point would be like seeing bigfoot riding a unicorn. you wouldnt believe thats what you were seeing. and then, through all the gawkers, a familiar face pushed through the crowd. here he was again. the juice. he had his camera ready. he was like, dave, chris. good to see you guys. hey, come on, guys. lets all get together for a picture. and at the same time, me and chris were like, no. i cant do that. sorry, juice, my career is too flimsy to survive a picture with you. thats the end. good night. ♪ ah-ah, ah-ah ♪\\n♪ in every ghetto ♪\\n♪ ah-ah ♪\\n♪ revolution ♪\\n♪ ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah ♪\\n♪ in every ghetto ♪ one last thing. before you go, i just wanted to acknowledge for the real comedy fans. we cant not acknowledge it. we lost a fucking juggernaut in comedy this week. so, im just shouting out the family and friends of garry shandling. much love to you guys. my sincerest condolences. and for the hip-hop fans in the building put two fingers up in the air for a tribe called quest and my man phife dawg. may he rest in peace forever and ever. thank you for that beautiful music. good night, everybody. thank you. twos up! twos up! hands up, hands up! twos up! were gonna do this for phife! i need everybody to rap with me right now! ♪ can i kick it? ♪\\n♪ yes, you can ♪\\n♪ can i kick it? ♪\\n ♪ yes, you can ♪\\n♪ can i kick it? ♪\\n ♪ yes, you can ♪\\n♪ well, im gone ♪\\n♪ go on, then ♪\\n♪ can i kick it? to my tribe that flows in layers ♪\\n♪ right now, phife is a poem sayer ♪\\n♪ at times, im a studio conveyor ♪\\n♪ mr. dinkins would you please be my mayor? ♪\\n ♪ youll be doing us a really big favor ♪\\n ♪ boy, this track really has a lot of flavor ♪\\n♪ when it comes to rhythms quest is your savior ♪\\n♪ follow us for the funky behavior ♪\\n♪ make a note on the rhythm we gave ya ♪\\n ♪ feel free, drop your pants check your hair ♪\\n♪ do you like the garments that we wear? ♪\\n ♪ i instruct you to be the obeyer ♪\\n♪ a rhythm recipe that youll savor ♪\\n ♪ doesnt matter if youre minor or major ♪\\n♪ yes, the tribe of the game were the player ♪\\n♪ as you inhale like a breath of fresh air ♪ im rich, biatch! your email address will not be published. required fields are marked * name* e-mail* website  \\n\\n stand-up special by jim gaffigan. louis c.k. being louis c.k. without restraint. comedian drew michael is taking the stage and is holding nothing back in his first hbo stand-up special, in which he navigates his fears, anxieties and insecurities in an unconventional stand-up setting. follows drew michael and his issues with relationships, social media, and comedy as therapy. ©  scraps from the loft. all rights '],\n",

-he said an horrible thing. he said loads of horrible things. yeah, but that was a thing that i care about. thats the thing about offense, its about personal feelings. i dont care about the backlash. comedian in hot water. you know? my girlfriend, jane, she worries, and she reads things. what have you said? dont worry. they wont come to the house. fuck em. so i wind her up. i pretend im gonna say much worse things than i ever would. i have to make up worse jokes than i actually just to scare my girlfriend. when i do the golden globes, we go out about a week before. its in la. we fly out. im writing jokes as the ceremony approaches. they release more presenters. i take my pick. i got a good intro for them. yeah. mel gibson? ill introduce him, yes. about three days before this last one, just to wind jane up, i said, i got a good intro. she went, what? i said, bill cosby would make our next presenter sleep on the couch. please welcome helen mirren! i didnt do it. she said, you wont do that? i said, no. next day, i got her again. i said, is this too much? i said, not even bill cosby carries enough tranquilizer to bring down this next magnificent beast. please welcome melissa mccarthy! i didnt do it! i would never id never tell a joke like that. its horrible. i was just doing it to annoy jane. id never even think of that, so dont even on the day, on the way to the red carpet, in the limo, i said, ill start\\xa0with a funny one-liner. an old-fashioned joke. she went, what? i said, what did the deaf, dumb and blind orphan get for christmas? jane went, i dont know. i said, cancer. i didnt do it, so youre getting offended at a joke that doesnt exist, so id never say that in public, so to anyone who mattered, anyway. so, dont i didnt have to worry about offending anyone. it just happens. the big controversy last time i did it was a caitlyn jenner joke. outrage on twitter the next day. i mean a couple of people going, it was transphobic. it wasnt transphobic in the slightest. it was a joke about a trans person, but it had nothing to do with that aspect of her existence. and thats the other thing about offense. people mistake the subject of a joke with the actual target. theyre not necessarily the same. ill tell you the joke, you make your minds up. its live, so they go, your host for the  annual golden globes awards, please welcome ricky gervais. theyre all clapping, the actors are smiling at me. nervously. its brilliant, right? so, i just go, relax, im gonna be nice tonight. ive changed. not as much as bruce jenner, obviously. and i go,\\xa0now caitlyn jenner, of course. and what a year shes had. became a role model for trans people everywhere, bravely breaking down barriers and destroying stereotypes. she didnt do a lot for women drivers thats a clever joke. ill tell you why. right? its layered. no, listen, right? the subject of that joke',\n",
       "  ' is stereotypes. im playing with the notion of stereotypes. i start by saying shes a real woman, a liberal, progressive attitude. then if shes a real woman, i hit them with the old-fashioned stereotype. she must be a bad driver, then. right? the target of the joke is a celebrity killing someone in their car. lets not forget that, shall we? a celebrity killing someone in their car, running home and popping on a dress. thats the target of the joke, just so were clear. okay? she was interviewed a week later at a\\xa0press conference for a show of hers. now cancelled. and one of the press said, what do you think of the ricky gervais joke? she went, maybe i should host the golden globes. and they tweeted that and @-ed me in, because they want a celebrity feud. it was clickbait. i rose to the bait. obviously i just sent back, let her host. just dont let her drive. another website that was in the room, entertainment weekly, they tweeted a different headline, and they @-ed me in. their headline was caitlyn finally breaks silence over ricky gervais. i just sent back: at last. she always brakes too late. bring it on. bring it on. but im a considered comedian. i like my jokes to be accurate and my targets to be fair. so i was engaging these people, saying, why is it transphobic? they said, its about a trans person. thats ridiculous. thats like saying a joke about bill cosby is automatically racist. it depends on the joke. but im willing to learn. i found out my crime was that i dead-named her. id never heard that term before a day after the golden globes. and that was saying her old name, and even acknowledging she used to be a man. but she did! i saw him on the olympic games! he was a decathlete,\\xa0he was in everything! all over the place! shot put and pole vault. he won a medal! he was famous! he was on telly all the time, you know? a big famous man. with a huge i dont know. im guessing. probably. he was big. but ive learnt my lesson. now i know its wrong. id never dead-name her now. but, years ago, when she was a man years ago, im saying. and she went to the doctor and knocked on the door. the doctor went, come in! this is years ago. id never dead-name her now, but this is like a flashback before anyone you know what so so, like, come in! and he went, hello, bruce jenner. because that that was his name then. the doctor– this was years ago the doctor went, all right, bruce jenner, how you doing, you fucker? you big old lunk. how you doing? come here, you, you fucker. how you doing, brucie boy? and bruce jenner– that was\\xa0his name. this is years ago. right? so bruce jenner went, yeah. yeah, not too bad, doctor. yeah. what can i do for you, bruce, you fucker? how you doing, boy? and bruce jenner went– that was his name. bruce jenner went look at that. the doctor went, come on, bruce jenner, you know the rules. he uses his whole name every time, for some reason come on, bruce jenner, you fucker. you know the rules. you cant bring your big old pole vaulting pole in here, mate. bruce jenner went, no, thats not my pole, thats my enormous penis. well, seeing as its your penis, you can bring it in here. but you should have left your shot puts outside. and bruce jenner went that was his name for fifty-eight years, i think. he went, no, theyre not my shot puts, doctor, theyre my enormous testicles. thats where i keep my testosterone, and my spunk, and shit, right? and the doctor went, oh yeah. that makes perfect– im a medical man. youre a big bloke. you fucker. how you doing, boy? youre a big youre big, and you would have a big old cock and balls. theyre beautiful. bit familiar, innit? no, you must be very proud of them, bruce. bruce went, this is going to surprise you, doctor. i wanna get rid of them. and the doctor went, what? why? oh, they get in the way. in the way of what? fucking driving, for one thing! so, im engaging these people, and im saying, but i had to say her old name. thats the joke. i say, ive changed. not as much as bruce jenner. then i do the joke. but, no. this is my second crime. i say, she hasnt changed. shes always identified\\xa0as a woman. that means shes a woman. fine, if thats the rules. if you feel youre a woman, you are. im not a bigot who thinks having all that done is science going too far. in fact, i dont think its going far enough. cause ive always identified as a chimp, right? well, i am a chimp. if i say im a chimp, i am a chimp. pre-op. but dont ever dead-name me. dont call me ricky gervais again. from now on, you call me bobo. im gonna have species realignment. im halfway there. im short, with short legs and long arms. i stoop. my backs getting hairier by the day. ive got fangs, like that. i love nuts. i love nuts. once, i was at the zoo, and people were looking at me, so i just started masturbating, like so i am a chimp, right? i am a chimp if i say im a chimp. ive got to live as a chimp for a year. then have hormones, get me all nice and hairy. thatd be lovely. im gonna stay a male chimp so i can keep all that, right? male, heterosexual chimp. keep the same girlfriend. jane would be happy. she loves me, she loves chimps, so you know. i reckon thats got to be easier for a man to turn into a chimp, were so close, than for a man to turn\\xa0into a woman, in many ways. a bit of hair, and a top lip like that, as opposed to your cock and balls ripped off and a hole gouged out, into– im not a doctor! but that is the gist of it. i know which one id rather have done. im not saying chimps are better than women. no way. right? any ladies here? i cant see you, but, to me, every single one of you is equa',\n",
       "  'l to a chimp. so so, id have all that done, hair and that. id do all that, all the ill retain the ability to speak english. like in emergencies. im talking to jane, shes going, what is it? what is it, bobo? you left the fucking oven on! theres a fire! are you saying that if caitlyn jenner was being chased by a wolf, and there was a big fence but she had a long pole, shed revert. shed be over that fucking easy. so id have all that done. top lip. doing all that. right? ill be legally a chimp. ill be well properly chimped-up. ill be able to use chimp toilets! ill be walking along, holding janes hand. come on, bobo. right? we dont hold hands now. i dont know why shes all over me now im a chimp. but well be all in love. maybe matching jumpers. come on, bobo. in love. just two like that. then, if a bigot in a van slows down and goes, thats fucking disgusting. ill fling shit at him and run up a tree. and thats why that joke isnt transphobic. so cheers. so, humanity. what is humanity? what are we? well, weve touched upon it there. were great apes. not metaphorically! were literally great apes. we are .% genetically identical to a chimpanzee. were closer to chimps than chimps are to gorillas. we left our common ancestor about six million years ago. we have the same life cycle. same as any other animal. which is our parents mate were born we grow we mate our parents die our friends die and then we die. now my seven-year-old niece didnt like hearing that. but i said, youve gotta learn. stop crying. i said, youre seven. you know today. so any more grizzling and this partys cancelled, so lets take the first of those. birth. its odd, because a human is born before the end of its natural gestation period. i mean, because of our evolution, our brain is so big, we have to get that huge head out early. thats why the skull is in parts and supple. then we go on gestating outside the womb. thats why were so useless. look at other mammals. a giraffe is walking along. it goes, im proper pregnant. right? im gonna have a baby giraffe right here. yeah, there it is. see you later. and the baby goes, mum! its got to be fucking ready. were were helpless, right? just think, nine months were growing in this perfect environment. everythings its like being in a little kate bush video, right? then, suddenly, youre being squeezed out of an hole near an ass. youre covered in shit, theres screaming. you go, i cant breathe. someone goes, yes, you fucking can! the first one second of life\\xa0on earth. you dont know where you are. you cant choose where youre born. i was\\xa0born in whitley estate in reading, right? i wouldnt have chosen that. id have chosen hampstead. i did choose hampstead. it just took\\xa0 years to be able to afford it. very different. very different, my upbringing to how i live now. now i live a privileged life. hampstead is ridiculous. its a rarefied place. its like the grandchildren of poets and painters and me, new money, right? but, growing up, it was tough! i dont know about now, but in my day, my estate was rough and scary. it felt like wildlife. i was weak and vulnerable. there was danger round every corner. my school was on my street and i ran there every day, so i didnt get mugged or molested. there werent many pedophiles\\xa0in reading, the murderers had killed a lot. but there was still a couple. i moved to hampstead. oh my god! theres no crime! i saw a knife once in hampstead. it was a palette knife. just a bloke, oil painting, in the middle of the street. broad daylight, no-one gobbing on it or calling him bender. it was weird! i know my life has changed drastically, it wasnt always like that. as a famous person, you read about yourself. gossip and twitter and everything. one thing kept cropping up, even as i prepared for this tour. people kept saying, hes out of touch. hes so famous. hes rich. hes mega-rich. i am. right? i could have this place burnt down for a laugh. no, but they say things like, hes an observational comedian. how can he say things that relate to ordinary scum. and i say.. i say, dont call them scum, right? but even the papers, they try and get around to it. i do interviews and theyll always say, do you always fly first class? i go, no. often private. right? the number of times ive answered this question. they say, do you know how much a pint of milk is? to make you look out of touch. i dont know, but thats irrelevant. next time a journalist asks me, ill say, i dont know. but heres\\xa0a grand. run and get me one. is that enough? that enough? yeah. another question i always get, particularly with the posh sundays, doing a profile piece. theyre still trying to alienate you, make you look different. they say things like, you dont have children. i say, no. why dont you have children? which is an odd question. why dont you have children? as opposed to asking people, why do you have children? lets ask the fat lady in the leggings why shes had eight, shall we? nine! that one just fell out. that one didnt even touch the sides. or disturb her cigarette. that one just go and claim for that. people say its selfish to not have children. how is it selfish to not bring\\xa0a life into the world that doesnt exist on any level? theres not a cabinet full of potential ghost fetuses going, we want to be born! right? but ive thought about it and theres three reasons i dont have children. three main reasons and ill share them with you. three reasons. one. theres millions! the worlds over-populated. no-ones going, ricks not having kids. were gonna run out. fuck. two. kids are scroungers. arent they? i mean, from day one, its a',\n",
       "  'll me, me, me, isnt it? feed me. clothe me. pay for my chemotherapy. no no. not my problem, son. not mine. luck of the draw, boy. luck of the draw. it costs the average household in the west $, to bring up a child. and they dont want to pay you back. theyre not grateful. they dont go, thanks for having me. its i didnt wanna be born. even if they get a top job, which they wont, youll never see that money back. theyll just put you in a home, okay? and my kid, hed be born into ridiculous wealth, wouldnt he? so hed be a little cunt. a little hampstead cunt running around with all the other fucking little hampstead cunts, being all hampstead and cunty. im a little hampstead cunt. yes, i know. these are my cunty friends. i know, its obvious. i can tell from your little fucking cunty hats that youre little hampstead cunts, you little posh hampstead first, hed know he was a little hampstead cunt. im a little yes, we know. everyone knows, right? hed know that, right? on the other hand, hed know hed never live up to being as brilliant as his dad. id say, i worked my way up from nothing, and youre just a useless hampstead cunt. hed go, yeah. and that would probably prey on his little mind a bit. eleven, twelve, hed be naughty, run with the wrong crowd, try and get out from under my shadow. then hed turn to drugs. about , hed come home, and overdose on my afghan rug. twenty grand, that was, right? and as he was there, convulsing, and throwing up his fucking lungs, right, and with his little posh, high-pitched, fucking death rattle his little fucking dying words, hed go, do you love me now, daddy? no! no. no, i never did. thats why youll never be born, you useless, fucking junkie, hampstead cunt. and, three id worry sick about him. you know? no i would!\\xa0ive only got a cat now and i worry sick about her. i check the door three times when i go out, so she doesnt escape. i put food and water in every room in case the door shuts and shes peckish. a human baby? oh my god, the responsibility of a human life? id watch it sleep. you know? we said how weak and vulnerable they are. oh, my god! you perfect little thing. oh, you flesh of my flesh. now, go to sleep in your expensive cot, like that. night, night. sleep tight. dont let the bedbugs dead. yeah. just why? why is it dead? its just fucking dead, look! fucks sake! fucking hell. what the what a fucking waste of time that was! fucks sake. embarrassing. jane? -what? -come here. -im in the shower. -come here. what? fucking dead already. i didnt just fucking fucking hell, jane. you call that a baby? that is if jane was out, id have to text her, wouldnt i? what could you babys dead. shed come back. what the fuck? id go, yep forget the pampers. lol. but even if it made it through the terrifying cot years, and it was a toddler running around head height to my antique tables, with their sharp edges. id have to pad them so it didnt run into it, cave its head in and die. then social services come round and say, is this your child, mr. gervais? -yeah. -what happened here, then? i go, its a fucking idiot. i did think of adopting for a while. a little third world child. because that would tick all three boxes. one, i wouldnt be adding to the population problem. id be alleviating an existing problem. a young kid born, through no fault of his own, into abject poverty, he would have died, i can literally save his life, and give him a great upbringing. right? two. he would be grateful, wouldnt he? hed wanna pay me back, woudnt he? particularly if i let him know the\\xa0other kids in the village werent so lucky. they didnt they didnt make it out. right? id tell him that early on, so he really bucked his ideas up. id go, tunde, come here. come here. yeah, yeah. go and pop a shirt on, youre not in africa now. thats better. yeah. tunde, look– yeah! water straight out of a tap, innit? yes! yeah. yeah! no, its not free. its hampstead, you know, but yeah, course its safe. safe, fresh drinking water. have as much as you want. have a bucket full. fresh drinking water. there you go. go and clean the car. go on. no, id go, look. remember all your friends in the village back in africa? theyre all dead. a rich man didnt save them and bring them to hampstead. -do you wanna pay me back? -yeah. yeah, i bet you do. the good thing about them is, they can start work when theyre about six. i just call up nike and i go do you still make your stuff in sweatshops? got a great little worker here, yeah. pound a days fine. hes gotta start somewhere. and, three if he ran round and caved his head in and died, and social services came round and said, is this your child, mr gervais? id go, does it look like mine? id go this is hampstead. its obviously broken in. thats why i dont have kids. even though i dont have children of my own, people still show me photos of theirs, like i give a shit. i dont mean my own family. theyve given up. ive got older brothers and sisters. theyve had loads of kids. and their kids have kids, and then their kids! theres about . i dont know\\xa0all their names. i see them at christmas. its all uncle ricky! they know ive got a bit of cash. they go through my pockets, and then fuck off. its like being mugged by mice, right? i dont mean them, i mean strangers. i could be busy, i could be working, like on the set of a tv or film or something, stressed, producing or directing it. you get someone whos in for one day, with one line, or a stuntman, they introduce themselves. good. be with you in a minute. then they hover. -busy? -i go, yeah! yes. yeah. they go, working the weekend? i go, not filming',\n",
       "  ', but ill be in the edit. im taking my youngest to ballet lessons. ah. great. great. yeah, shes eight. ive got a photograph. i go, you know what? show me it if she goes missing. ill keep an eye open in the woods. youve gotta go through the whole polite rigmarole, and go, shes beautiful. its gotta be long.\\xa0too short, its awkward. they know. you go, yeah, right. too long and its like, shes shes fucking beautiful. its a minefield, innit? so im not out of touch. but i am spoiled. theres a difference. i didnt have any money until i was . ive got the same family, friends and values. but i am spoiled. because opportunity and privilege spoils you. and it doesnt take much. il give you an example. when i first made it in america, the next time we flew, were met by a bloke in a suit and a thing. and he just walked us past the queue and straight out the other side. the first time, youre horrified. everyones looking. pretending to be late, baseball cap. oh, god. next time we flew, i went, wheres that bloke? im not queueing! its quick! when i fly to the states, ive got a place there, but im always working. so, someone else is paying. so, i go first class. ba. it doesnt get any better. even if i was paying, id still go first class, but jane would probably be in coach its ten grand a pop! that new planet of the apes movies on. shell love that. shell be up for that. but when someone else is paying, i say, jane, get up here with me. right? front two seats they board us early. were on the plane about  minutes before anyone else. god. they bring round these snacks, these warmed, caramelized nuts in a bowl. champagne. its great. its like a day off. no phone or anything. its like\\xa0a holiday, flying to the states.\\ni could do without the safety video. thats always a bit of a downer. and totally pointless. if you hit the side of a mountain at  miles per hour, the brace position does fuck all. imagine if that worked. youre going down, the plane smashes. you go, ill try it. you do that. ball of flames, you wake up, everyones dead. you go, fucking hell, thats amazing, that is! and they always use that voice, dont they? that calming, hypnotic voice, like, nothing bad will happen. theyre saying horrendous things, but nothing bad will happen, because im using this voice, dont worry. things like, in the event of the plane landing on water– it smashes the fuck to bits, right? they say, in the event of the plane landing on water, your life jacket is equipped with a whistle. a fucking whistle. so, the plane hits the water, smashes to bits, everyones dead, except you, by a miracle. youre bobbing around in the atlantic ocean. four degrees, that water is. youve got about  minutes before hypothermia sets in. or youre eaten by a shark, or you drown. youre hoping theyve sent air-sea rescue. youre going, god, im\\xa0gonna die, i dont know what im doing! hold on! i mean, air sea rescue i dont know if youve ever been\\xa0in a helicopter. o course you havent. but theyre fucking loud. its like having your head in a washing machine. you have to wear ear plugs and defenders. your teeth rattle. its like like that. over the atlantic ocean at night. never gonna happen. if you crash, you die, right? but apart from that, its brilliant. right i was flying heathrow to jfk just before christmas, right? boarded us early, on the plane. she comes round. champagne in a wine glass, like you like it, mr. gervais. she goes off. i go, have you got\\xa0any of them warm nuts? she went, were not handing out nuts on this flight. a ladys getting on whos so allergic, even someone eating nuts nearby would cause her to have a fatal reaction. i went, oh, my god, of course. i was fuming. i mean whats that got to do with me? why cant i eat nuts, just cause fucking this woman will die, right? nuts! how has she lived this long? if walking by a nut kills you if being just near a nut how has she never been near a nut before? and how has she lived long enough, having never been near a nut, how has she lived long enough to earn enough money to be near me on a plane, right? honestly. its and if being near a nut kills you, do we really want that in the gene pool? i mean i never wanted nuts more. i felt she was\\xa0infringing on my human right to eat nuts. and this is how spoiled i am, okay? i actually had this thought. i thought, oh, i wish id brought my own nuts on. right?. i thought for a second, but that wouldnt work. shed get on and start blowing up like a frog, right? like that and die. and someone would go, ricky gervais brought his own nuts on. you know, right? so i dont take my own nuts on. now, before i fly, i have a shower, and then i rub myself all over in nuts just in case. then i go, can i have any nuts? they go, no, sorry, this lady would die. yeah, not a problem. lady gets on, sits down, starts blowing up like a frog i go, whats the matter? i touch her all over. whats the matter? she goes, nuts! right? and dies. and i go, whos been eating nuts? i get off scot-free. so i got to america, i went on a chat show. tonight show with jimmy fallon. and i told that story, the whole thing. it went well, audience laughed. great. went out. next day on twitter, outrage. by outrage, i mean one person going, how dare you? this woman goes, i saw you on\\xa0jimmy fallon, making fun of nut allergies. my daughters nut-intolerant. how dare you? i go, who is this woman? shes tweeted  times. she starts @-ing nbc and jimmy fallon. i go, whats this? how many followers? twenty-three. ignore it. you know when youre being told off, and they use your own words against you, like a teacher going, so, you find so a',\n",
       "  'nd so funny? and cause the teachers really angry, yes, you do find that thing funny, whatever she said would you find it funny if my daughter blew up like a frog? yeah. yeah, you saying that yes. if you said that at the funeral, i would, yeah so, someone else gets involved. ohio moms against nuts, right? and she does a blog, and theyre talking to each other, and she puts me in her blog about how disgusting i am. one filmed her little girl, put it on youtube, and sent me it. i opened it. sweet little girl, seven years old. and she went, dear mr. gervais, i have a fatal nut allergy. delete. not my problem, right? ignore. ignore. ignore. right? but then one of them said something that reeled me in. just cause im this self-confessed twitter police. i try and explain to someone every day what freedom of speech means, particularly in the context of comedy, and in the context of a joke. a joke about a bad thing isnt as bad as the bad thing, or necessarily condoning the bad thing. it could be anti the bad thing. it depends on the actual joke. and this woman said you should never make jokes about food allergies. i should have left it, right? i sent back, i make jokes about aids, cancer, famine, and the holocaust. and youre telling me i should never joke about food allergies? she sent back, yes,\\xa0but the holocaust didnt kill children. well it did, didnt it? it was horrible, the holocaust. some would say as bad as food allergies. didnt kill children jesus. it did kill children. hitler killed  million people, many of them children. i have to say, hitler, you couldnt make him up. the worst human being to walk the face of the earth. he is a crazy evil, racist, narcissistic serial killer. just terrible. but if i was throwing a dinner party, and id been slaving over a hot stove, and i was getting everything ready, and there was one place left, and i had to either invite hitler or that little girl with food allergies i know whod ruin that party more. everyones enjoying it. everything okay? ja, ist\\xa0yummy! right? hes loving it. i go, cheers, you fucker! how you doing, boy? shes going, i cant eat that. fucking hell. who wants ferrero rocher? me! all right. here! i cant eat them. oh, fuck off home. right?\\nthats what the worlds like. people see something they dont like, they expect it to stop, as opposed to deal with their emotions. they want us to care about\\xa0their thing as much as they do. its why the world is getting worse, and the world is getting worse. i think ive lived through the best  years of humanity  to , the peak of civilization, for everything. for tolerances, for freedoms, for communication, for medicine. now its going the other way a bit. last couple of years, just a little blip, maybe. im not saying this because im old. old people say things like, oh, everything was better when i was a kid. course it was. you were a kid. everythings better when youre a kid. being old is the shit bit. whatevers happening, being old is i wake up these days, and i go, oh fuck, i didnt die. gotta do it all again. im usually hung over, headache, liver pains. i cant walk for the first five minutes, cause ive got no joints in my knees. im getting fat again now, right? i was thin till i was about ,\\xa0proper skinny, like nine and a half stone. then i got a job, right? and the next, sort of,  years were what i call my eating years and i just got steadily fatter and fatter. until i reached a peak of unwellness and blobbiness, when i was about  years old. there was one christmas, i was at home, lying on the floor and i was saying to jane, im having a heart attack. right? and, honestly, my heart rate was like . i felt nauseous, i had palpitations, i was sweating. because id eaten eleven sausages. true story, right? i was like one of them snakes. like when you see a big, like python swallow a pig whole. and then its just fucked. its, like itll sit there for a week. its like a duffel bag. just there, like that. that was me, right? i wasnt having a heart attack, but it worried jane. she said, you gotta look after yourself. i thought, youre right. . so i started working out, right, every day. i didnt give anything up. i dont eat meat anymore. but i was having ,  calories\\xa0a day, including wine every night. but i burnt it off the next day. just so i could do all that, i worked out every day, running, weight training i had more time on my hands than the average person. i had a gym in my house, i had no excuse. i lost  pounds. it was great. but now, i still eat and drink too much, but i physically cant\\xa0burn off the calories. i cant do enough. cause im so old and broken and tired. so, im going to get steadily fatter and fatter again, and this time i am going to die. im losing my hair. its getting really thin. i know it looks great from there. cheers, but no, honestly, in a lift, with that light directly overhead, and the mirror, it looks like an x-ray, right? ill have to buzz that off soon. id never wear a wig, oh, my god. if you wear a wig or a toupee, and you think youve got away with it you havent. everyone knows. everyone knows immediately. my brain knows a wig\\xa0has come into the room before i do, right? i could be at a party, itll go, theres a wig in here. -i go. is there? -yes! there is, yeah! spidey senses for the wig. its obvious. the way they smile, like nothings wrong. hiya. its the telltale signs, isnt it? i was put off wigs for life by my uncle reginald. great bloke. hes dead now. died a few years ago. i was only little. he went bald in his twenties. tragically bald. his hair fell out. it might have been something like alopecia. but',\n",
       "  ' he was bald for ten years into his thirties. turns up one day at our house elvis! what is– i was about eight, i said to auntie edna, what happened? she went, it was a miracle. they were lying! they were just everyone knew he was bald! but hed embroiled his family in the lie, so they had to lie as well. theyre going, yeah, it just grew back. theres so much he wouldnt do, cause he was terrified of the wig coming off. we werent allowed balloons at parties, right? auntie edna said, reg is allergic to balloons. he wasnt allergic. he was terrified one of us kids would rub one on our sweater, and his wig would fly across the room. weve got photos in the family album. if hes at a wedding or a christening, and hes holding a baby, its always at arms length. like that. so it cant grab his wig. it must have been on his mind all the time, right? it was the only thing he feared, the wig coming off in public, and this ridiculous lie being exposed. he was in the army, hard as nails. he wasnt scared of anyone or anything. spiders, snakes cancer hows the chemo going, uncle? not a problem. weve got a photo of him, the last year, i think. he was . it must have been the last year he was alive. it was a hot day. he was in the garden. in his little trunks. he was a wizened little man by then. white chest hair. jet black wig still! died in it, buried in it. hes wearing it now. a little skeleton with jet black hair. like posh spice for eternity. but i knew that was gonna happen. i knew i would get old and fat and ill and blind and deaf and shit myself and be pushed round in a fucking bucket. youre ready, because youre warned. you know about getting old. what they dont talk about, so youre not prepared, and it was a shock to me i only found out recently, ill share it with you now. the distending testicles. see, you dont know about it. but it happens in your fifties. i wasnt checking them or anything i didnt see em for  years. as a young man, they were pert, and now theyre like two plums in a sock. i dont know when it happened, but it was recently. they just and this is how i found out. so, as ive been getting older, and theyve been secretly stretching away as ive got older, ive got richer, so my baths have been getting more luxurious. last year, i moved into a new house in hampstead. big bath. big sunken bath. south-facing windows. i was in there the first night. lovely bath. sun streaming in, classical music, this is the life. i looked down. and theyre floating. right? now, id never dreamt that testicles would float. they seem like theyd be heavy. you could tie things down with them, and theyd sink. you know? most people never see their in the sea, youre in trunks, in the shower, they dangle, and baths arent usually that deep! that was my first thought. oh, my god, i never thought testicles would float. then my second thought kicked in. hold on, this baths two feet deep! right? im sitting on the bottom, theyre on top. whats going on? right? and i looked, and my testicles are now longer than my penis. easily, by some way, right? in fact, theyd created, a little, fleshy sort of life raft, right? my penis was dry, just nestled, just floating on top. like that. like that. just bouncing around. i should have given it a little whistle. im just thinking, this is bizarre. fucking hell, right? and i thought, maybe its a fluke. so i held them under the water for a minute, i let them go and they bobbed up! theyre really theyre really buoyant, right? try it when you get home, if youre in your . and a man, obviously. or caitlyn jenner. but but the world is getting worse. and i blame the beginning of its demise on social media. because twitter and facebook, thats where this ridiculous notion bred, and became stable, that it was more important to be popular than right. everything was like me, agree with me. it falls into two tribes. i dont agree with them, so i block them. and now, in this post-truth era, people dont care about the argument, they say, whos saying the argument? no, theyre not on our side. its ludicrous, okay? and it also bred this ridiculous notion weve always had. my opinion is worth as much as yours. now, its my opinion is worth as much as your fact, which is nonsense. i get tweets from people saying, i believe the earth is , years old. i believe youre a fucking idiot. you cant have an opinion on the age of the earth. you can have opinions, but not your own facts. but it was all about being popular, right? and even politicians picked up those symptoms. politicians tweet now, they want to be popular. we had a brexit referendum cause they passed the buck. they didnt want to make a mistake. and theres a ridiculous thing of, lets ask the average person what they think. lets stop asking the average person what they do you know how fucking stupid the average person is? we still sell bottles of bleach with big labels on that say do not drink. right? lets take those labels off, right? for two years. and then have a referendum. but its not just politicians. even real news. the news on tv says things like, tweet us your news. dont let them tweet you the news! -i saw a tyrannosaurus rex. -you liar! right? there was a big news story last year, about a train crash that happened a year before, and there was an inquiry. the results of the inquiry were published and there was an expert on the news. he said, weve looked at everything, and weve decided that the speed of the trains was a contributing factor, so were going to slow them down a bit. statistically, this shouldnt happen again. that would have been it. but the guy went, we a',\n",
       "  'sked the public what they thought. then there was three banal vox pops. first one said, i already pay £ a year, so im not happy. the next one said, it takes me  minutes each way, its not good enough. the last one said, i say its better to arrive at work late than dead. why is that on the news? and when is that applicable in any situation? all right, ted? youre in early. ted? oh, ted! weve been through this. remember i said id rather you arrive late than dead? but the big enemy is stupidity right? i wanna share with you the most stupid tweet i ever got. now, admittedly, when i first got on twitter, i pushed my agenda. i was an outspoken atheist. not to change anyones opinions. i thought it was important to tell the other side. there are still  countries where people are put to death for being an atheist. i just wanted to say, its fine to be an atheist. its fine to believe in god, and its fine not to. thats all i was saying. i realized i didnt have to tweet about religion or atheism. i could tweet a fact, and that annoyed just the right people. id tweet things like happy birthday, earth. four point six billion years old today. someone would always go, we know what youre fucking doing. this is a tweet i got\\xa0after one of those. and it was all in capitals, which excited me thats the sign of twitter madness. mixed with anger. its great, right? i looked at his profile. sure enough, hes a gentleman from texas. hes a fundamentalist, creationist christian. which is fine! he loves god. he loves god and fetuses, mainly. he loves the fetus from conception to when it turns out gay, and then hes remember its in capitals. hes shouting at me. best tweet ever. your science– my science, right? science, by the way, is spelled s-c-i-e-n-t-s. already good, isnt it? i mean hes obviously heard the word, he took a guess never seen it written down, because its not in the bible. so hes your scients wont help you well, it will. its helping him beam this little message up to a satellite and down to me. your scients wont help you when satan of course he believes in satan. why not? he believes that god made the universe in six days. youre not gonna say to him, do you believe in satan? and have him say, bit far-fetched. why doesnt god kill satan? thats what id ask him. if i was wrong and i met god, id go, oh, you do exist. hed go, yeah. id go, ive got a few fucking questions, mate. the first one would be, why did you make chocolate kill dogs? mental, right? also, if you hate homosexuality so much, why did you put the male g-spot up the arse? what what is wrong with you? then id say, why dont you kill satan? and hed go, what? id go, why dont you kill satan? if he does all the bad stuff and you do\\xa0all the good stuff, which you want i mean, you do want– yes, yeah. you could kill him if you wanted, you can do anything, easy. yeah. why dont you kill him, then? because shut up. your scients wont help you when satan is raping your british ass. and hes got a point. because if i die, and i find myself in hell, being raped by satan science has pretty much let me down. but its this last line that he just throws away. the line he signs off with, makes this the best tweet ive ever received. your scients wont help you when satan is raping your british ass. ill be laughing. so hes there too! hes so, hes a fundamentalist christian, whos lived his life by the old and new testaments. he dies, he wakes up in hell, right? which must be off the charts on the scale of emotional trauma oh, my god, im in hell! oh, my god, why have you forsaken me? im gonna be tortured for eternity! he sees me getting raped and goes, ha, ha, ha! hes suddenly over it, is he? his days suddenly got a little bit brighter. and like hes not next, right? so im getting raped, right, by the devil, right? hes just there. you fucking atheist scum. and im like that. yeah, whatever. i assume it happens all eternity. yeah, yeah, whatever. like that. i might say, watch your hooves on my testicles. and hed go, why are they so distended? and i go, oh, like youre brad pitt! you know what i mean? sorry, are we talking or raping? can we you lying, fucking atheist. hes probably bored. fucking atheists. every fucking day. right? his little gargoyle comes up. satan? he goes, what? and i go, yeah? what? he goes, theres a fundamentalist christian. fuck this! hed be on him like a ton of bricks! so i got that tweet. i loved it. all i did was re-tweet, right? and just watch the fun, people piling on, going, ah, loser! and hes fighting back, really witlessly, saying things like, go fuck your sister, you english faggot! that makes no sense at all. i forgot about it. went and did something else. few hours later, on twitter again. its still all going off, right? its really funny, im laughing at all the replies. people saying things to him. im scrolling down. theres one tweet, directly to me, from this woman. she says, you find rape funny? no! no! what? no your mates find rape funny? no! listen, right? you find rape funny? listen, everyone! listen, right? no i said to her, i didnt tweet that. -she went, you retweeted it. -to show hes an idiot. but you must find it funny or amusing. its not a frivolous thing. i said, no, well, its up to him, isnt it? he can do it. now im arguing with quite a nice, sane person, who thinks this is mental. but im fighting for his right to fantasize about me being raped by the devil. because im so conscious of freedom of speech what a topsy-turvy world, right? although her opening gambit annoyed me a bit. because she did that thing that people do. she didnt say, what, you ',\n",
       "  'find jokes about rape funny? she said, what, you find rape funny? the answer to that is, no, of course not. no one finds rape funny. not even rapists find rape funny, know what i mean? noone ever gives evidence saying, it was dark, he wore a ski mask, and he was giggling. thats never so i sent back, you mean jokes about rape? she said, yes. -i went, depends on the joke. -it fucking doesnt! im going, no, it does! it does! it depends on the joke. its about context,\\xa0its about content. what do you mean by a rape joke? she said, even a joke with the word rape in it is unacceptable. i said, thats ridiculous, it depends what the joke is. i tweeted that clip of me in the office, going, i think theres been a rape up there! everyone gets that because of the context. and the target is a middle-aged man, whos so narcissistic, hell say anything to win a silly game. you have to understand the joke and where it comes from. i said,\\xa0some jokes dont punch up or down. they dont punch anywhere. they can just be a pun, a play\\xa0on words, that dont really mean anything. a joke went round when i was a kid, even adults told it. ill tell you. a woman goes running into a police station. she says, help, ive been graped! the policeman says, do you mean raped? she says, no, there was a bunch of them. that is a rape joke, right? so. and i even said to her, no, i agree, in most cases, yeah. real rape jokes,\\xa0they are fucking horrible when the victim is the target. disgusting! id never tell those. but it depends on the joke, not the word or the subject. i calmed it down, and they agreed some jokes are worse than others. she ended it by saying, well, okay, i see your point, but still i will laugh at a joke with the word rape in it, when no-one in the audience has been raped. i should have left it. i just sent back, what a weird door policy. you turn up to a comedy gig, pay your money, someone says, can i just ask you a question? yeah. have you ever been raped? i have, yes. you cant come in. what? why? a lady says she wont laugh if youre in. off you go. thats what the world is like. people take everything personally. they think the world revolves around them, particularly on twitter. im not tweeting anyone, im just tweeting. i dont know whos following me. ive got  million followers. they can be following me without me knowing, choose to read my tweet, and then take that personally. thats like going into a town square, seeing a big noticeboard saying guitar lessons, and you go, but i dont fucking want guitar lessons! whats this? theres a number here. right, call that. are you giving guitar lessons? i dont fucking want any! fine! its not for you, then. just walk away. dont worry about it.\\ni should say one thing in twitters defense. i use it as a marketing tool and for fun, like everyone else. but one great thing about twitter, for me, personally, im very into anti animal cruelty. years ago, it would take ages to get , signatures on a petition. standing outside tescos or something. thats the magic number, because then it gets heard in parliament. ive been part of many campaigns through twitter when weve got , signatures in days, and the law has been changed. thank you to those whove retweeted about animal cruelty. it makes a difference. thank you. but even something as clear and distinct as animal cruelty, you think no ones gonna argue with that. yes, they will. they just wanna be heard. ill tweet something about a bull being tortured in a bullring for entertainment. i say, ban bullfighting. someone always says, what about the kids in syria? what? well, im not giving you a choice. you can do both. im not saying, throw that kid back in the hole, theres a bull here! and theres one thing that i didnt want in my head, but it exists, so we have to deal with it now that i found out, through twitter. theres a thing called the yulin dog meat festival, in china, every year. and its horrendous. and we send people with money to buy the dogs, to bring them back. its a drop in the ocean. they eat thousands over this weekend. i tweet the details, the petition, people dont really read it. its a knee-jerk. people say, racist! i go, what? they go, we eat pigs and cows in the west. yep, we do. i dont but, yeah, i used to. youre right, a pig or a cow is worth as much as a dog. its not about the species. its what they do to these poor dogs. what they do is torture the dogs first. cause they think it makes the meat taste better. they beat them, they blowtorch them. they even skin them alive. and i saw this picture on twitter of the opening of this ceremony. these two guys, in this chinese square, and theyre skinning this dog alive. its screaming, theyre laughing. its the worst thing ive ever seen. i thought, ive got to tweet that. i tweeted the picture, with a petition, and i just said, one beautiful creature, and two ugly cunts, skinning it alive. right? and it took off. loads of retweets, it made the press. i got one tweet back, from a woman, that said, is that language necessary? i should have left it, right? but i was i was incensed! i said, youre more offended by a word than by an animal being tortured to death? she said, i just hate the c-word. i definitely should have left it. i sent back, people who hate the c-word would hear it a lot less, if they didnt go round acting like such cunts. thank you! youve been fantastic! good night! cheers! thank you so much! thank you so much. i hope you enjoyed the show. i hope no-one was offended. no, i really do! thats not the point. ive always wanted people to know they can laugh at bad things, without being bad',\n",
       "  ' people. i think its my upbringing. i grew up in poverty, with nothing. but the point was to pay your way then have a laugh. that was the men. the women carried on working. it was my older brother, bob, it was him who i first saw making these dark jokes, right in the bad situation, as things were happening. people were laughing. i realized, hes healing them. thats what comedys for, what humors for. it gets us over bad stuff. right? typical bob story. he once spent an hour in the pound shop in hayling island, just asking the cashier how much everything was. just to see if he could break this poor mans will. bob was the first person i saw answer back to authority. the first authority you come across are your parents. and hed get in trouble. he got sent to bed. but i thought hed won the argument. and hed tease my mum. my mum was a typical working-class woman. as i say, we lived in a shitty area, right? and most of the houses looked like a bit of mud, and a stolen bike, and fence posts missing. she mended the fence, turfed the garden herself, painted the step. she thought, if it looked\\xa0respectable, wed be respectable. it was about reputation, i guess. bob would send her postcards that just read, is that pedophile postman still reading your mail? and shed take it, shed go in, and shed be horrified. shed call bob. he saw it this time, you must stop doing that! even at her funeral my mum died first, and my dad carried on for a year or so, just drinking beer, then he went. at mums funeral, we had different duties. i did catering and flowers. bob went to see the local vicar. that was a mistake, right? wed never been to church, he didnt know us, we didnt know him. so, he said to bob, tell me about your mum, so i can say a few words. bob saw that as an opportunity, right? so, bob, with a straight face, said, well, she was a keen racist. the vicar went, i cant say that. bob said, okay, put she liked gardening. he was trying to get\\xa0the vicar to say something to make us laugh in church. he didnt warn us. and he did get something by the vicar. so were called ricky, robert– bob– ricky, robert, marsha and larry. now, larry is the oldest, in his seventies. born in the war. i always thought he was the sensible one. first born, weight of the world on his shoulders. my mum said, when he was a teenager, he got a job and gave her the money to help out. hes a stand-up guy, larry. so, bob gives the vicar the wrong name. didnt warn us. were all in church. start of the funeral, were all there. packed out. the coffin comes down. guided by the vicar. the vicar goes to his pulpit. all confident, with his little notes, right? and he goes eva leaves behind four loving children. ricky. robert. marsha. and barry. and we snort like that, right? bobs going everyone realizes. were all laughing. we see larry go all right. and the church is like every time we thought of it, wed see larry go like that, right? then wed just start giggling, just fits of fucking giggles, right? larry eventually started doing this. and the vicars thinking, what have i said? right? hed put in a few things the vicar didnt know that set us off again. things that were just lies, or slightly wrong. my nieces and nephews started crying. id come prepared with a pack of tissues. theyd take one and hand it on. before the funeral, id taken the tissues out, written on them, folded them back and put them in. and each tissue said, snivelling fucking bitch. and theyre sort of laughing. so it was like a madhouse, right? everything the vicar said or did, we all\\xa0started fucking laughing! right? and you could see the vicar was visibly shook a little bit. he ended the funeral, and he made a beeline for me and bob. he said, sorry, was that okay? me and bob went,\\xa0fucking brilliant,\\xa0mate. it was fucking brilliant. thats what i mean. were all\\xa0gonna die, so we should have a laugh. if you can laugh in the face of adversity, youre bullet-proof. me and my brother, bob, had one simple rule, and that was if you think of something funny, youve got to say it. win, lose or draw. it might go well it might go badly. but youve gotta say it. and bear that in mind, as i leave you with this. right so were all in the car one day. bobs driving. packed in this car. a little day trip to the beach. we get stopped for a security check. and theres a british bobby there. and he stops the car. bobs at the window. he said, where are we off to? bob went, bognor. he went,\\xa0can you just pop the boot, please? so he looks at that. looks in the boot, like that. back to bobs window. gets that mirror on a stick thing. and he starts just looking under the car. and as he does that, his helmet falls off, right? and out of the helmet falls a packet of  cigarettes. and the copper went, bet you always wondered what we kept under our helmets. and bob went, i knew it wasnt fucking brains. youve been amazing. good night! prolefeed. your email address will not be published. required fields are marked * name* e-mail* website  \\n\\n an interview with a sick child hits tony hard. later, he makes a decision about lisas insurance money and joins his friends at the town fair. anne gives tony some advice on moving forward, emma crosses paths with an old friend, matt suffers a health scare, and james stands up for himself. matt searches for a sport at which he can beat tony, lenny asks tony to be his best man, and kath has dinner with a persnickety teacher. tony takes a trip with matt to honor his father. james has second thoughts about his new living arrangements. tony helps kath score a date. ©  scraps from the loft. all rights re'],\n",

       "  'd while simultaneously still kind of believing that a woman who never got fucked had a baby that walked on water, died, and came back three days later. so yeah. that made total sense to me. so it just hit me one day, i was like, why does that make sense and that shit doesnt, you know? they got a spaceship in theirs, you know? we– right? we got the space shuttle, you know? theres sneakers. theres a lot of shit i can relate to in this. why does that sound so dumb to me? you know what it is? i think its cause i heard their story when i was an adult. i heard my story when i was four years old, right? when i heard my story, there was still some fat fuck coming down the chimney, giving me christmas toys. if i lost a tooth, there was a fairy. there was the easter bunny. why wouldnt there be some bearded baby moonwalking across the lake? throwing out bottomless buckets of shrimp or whatever he did? of course that made sense. what happened was, as i got older, all of that stuff started to fall, right? ah, son, there is no fat fuck, its your mother and i. your moms the tooth fairy, rabbits dont have eggs, her tits are fake, the nba is fixed! bankers are cunts! most of your dreams wont come true! right? and i was just like, wow, this is how the world is. and meanwhile this shit was just floating, this -pound gorilla of this fucking story. i just had to make a decision, what am i gonna do? what am i gonna do with this? am i gonna cling to it, be that person? thats very offensive to me and other christians and become that douche? all right? and be like the casual christian, right, with, like, one foot on base, just, yeah, i kind of go, a couple of times a year, and, like, if my parents come to town, i act like i go all the time, and i dont go anymore. or my last option, which was basically just, just let go of the shit, you know? just let go. [cheers and applause] just let go of it like that creepy moment in curling. you know. that moment where the shooter, or whatever you call them, is just sliding with that rock, right? just let me do this right, just sliding. and you think hes along for the ride, the two of them, theyre a team, and all of a sudden out of nowhere he just goes fucking that rock just keeps going, this dude just stops. thats what i did with my religion. i just let go of it. i didnt read a riot act to anybody, i just let go of it. and on the third day, he rose again in fulfillment of the scriptures i just floated away. [cheers and applause] so now its like, im in this weird place where im not in any religion right now. unrestricted free agent. you know? [cackles] id like to believe in something, so ive been going around asking people what their shit is, and i havent been able to find anything. trying to be open-minded. i was doing a gig in helsinki, and over there, theyre, like, lutheran, and what they believe, they believe when you die, youre dead and thats it. dead, like a pigeon, just– just layin there. over. blew my mind, im like, really? youre just dead? like my religion was you die, and then you go up to get judged, right? god pops in the dvd of your life. well, i dont know about this right here. mind explaining yourself? this might be the most arrogant thing i say all night, but i actually resent the fact that im gonna get judged someday. like, if thats true, that somebodys gonna judge me, that doesnt even make any sense. its like, dude, you made me, so this is your fuck-up. all right? lets not try to turn this around on me. you know? jesus christ. you give me freedom of choice, you make whores, you have me suck at math, and you dont think this things gonna go off the rails? like, you set me up to fail, and now you got the balls to now question your own goddamn work. dude, if i made a car, if i built a car and it didnt run, i wouldnt burn it forever. you evil piece of shit! just light it on fire. i wouldnt, i would troubleshoot. is there gas in the engine? is the battery charged? anything beyond this, i got to get a real man to look at it, but i believe in you. im gonna try and help you out. yes, my religion, its nuts. its fucking nuts. like, my religion, like, the way i was brought up is like, you know, you can make it to heaven but, like, some of your family members possibly couldnt, or some of your friends. doesnt even make sense. like how am i supposed to enjoy heaven if thats the deal, right? just sitting here, waiting for my friends to show up, jesus christ, where the hell are they? its been, like,  years! they must have ate a lot of brussels sprouts or some shit! doing some yoga, right? and then one day, it just settles in that they didnt make it. and then what, im still gonna enjoy heaven, right? jesus coming walking over: hey, how is it going, everybody? isnt this great? isnt this great? yeah, dude, itd be even better if all my family members and friends werent burning for fucking ever! kind of hard to enjoy heaven when you just keep thinking of that there, j-star, what do you think? hey, dude, i didnt ask you to come over. you came walking over with your big, dumb sandals. hey, hey, how is it going over here? why did you come over here? i dont give a damn. dude, tell your dad. i dont give a fuck! im already in here, im already in here. what, are you gonna kick me out afterwards? go fuck yourself. i knew he was gonna be like that, i knew it. the bosss son is the worst. fucking sense of entitlement. so yeah, so they believe when you die, youre dead. and i was like, so youre just dead. like, how do you wrap your head around not existing? i couldnt get my head around it. he goes, well, like before, when you were born, do you remember that? and i was like, no, and the guys like, yeah, its just like that. im like, not only does that make sense, that is absolutely terrifying. dude, i got to be honest, i hate how scared im getting as i get older. im developing all these new fears. like, i have a fear of flying now. i never had a fear of it. its not straight-across-the-board flying. i dont like small planes all of a sudden. i just dont like them, and it has nothing to do with the plane. i believe in the planes, okay? i just dont believe in the pilots. cause you know what? i dont think the airline does, either. which is why that dude is flying that little plane. the airline was basically, like, all right, well give you, like,  people. see how you do, you',\n",
       "  ' know? you fly them up, you land, you bring another  back. well let you do this for a while. you do this for a while, we dont get any complaints, no up and down, up and down, none of that shit, well move you up to  people. and then one day, youll be in a jet– whoo! were going a little faster. right? big planes, youre getting the fuckin pilot that knows what hes doing. hes probably fought in a war. hes used to getting shot at. he cant bring this bus in? its a joke. right? a bunch of people whining in the back, my headphones dont work! he doesnt give a fuck, right? hes up there sleeping. hes trying to make something happen, hes so goddamn bored. thats a stud up there, right? so one time im flying into albany, new york, okay, a city that nobody really goes to. so im on a smaller plane, and everything is going great. all of a sudden, out of nowhere, we hit this turbulence. [imitating sounds of turbulence] and it stops, and everybody looks around laughing nervously, like [nervous laughter] all of a sudden, it comes back with a vengeance. you can literally hear the metal the planes made of, like all of a sudden, this dude three rows back starts making these bitchy noises. whoa! whaaa! whoa! whaaaa! whoa! im not gonna lie, i have never been so fucking scared in my entire life. dude, that noise is acceptable out of a female or a child. but turn around and see a -year-old mustachioed male going whoo! whaaa! whoa! dude, the hair was standing up on my arms. im praying to a higher power, i dont even believe in the shit! i just wish i had the balls to turn around and be like, dude, would you shut the fuck up? jesus christ, be a man, push it down. push it down, deny your feelings, act like you have answers. do some man shit right now. do some man shit. jesus christ. you know? you think im not up here thinking whaaa! whoa! i am! but how does that help us for me to join you and turn this fuselage into a haunted house? you know what kills me, what absolutely kills me, is some woman is gonna fall in love with this guy, marry him and make half whooo whaaaa fucking kids. and you know what? we become weaker as a species. we do. [cheers and applause] do you remember back in the day when you watched the discovery channel about animals? now they build cars, but it used to be about animals, right? now its all car stuff. looking forward to getting that carburetor today. the carburetor didnt fit. what do you mean the carburetor doesnt fit? dads gonna be mad. [yelling gibberish] theres never enough time to build the car. its so fucking stupid. we got to have this bus done by thursday! or else what? the guy doesnt want it anymore? all right. youll get the thing when we finish it, okay? this is a safety issue. you want brakes on it? then go get yourself some fucking lunch. so, before [laughter] before there used to just be animals, and this is what i noticed: everything from a lion all the way down to an insect, okay? if you had one drop of whoo whaaa bitchy blood in you, none of the females would fuck you. that was it, your life was over. your life was over. no ant pussy for you your entire miserable eight-day ant life, cause all six of your legs shook when the wind blew, and the female ant saw it. theyre like, all right, stay away from that one. stay away from that one. hes gonna jeopardize the whole hill. and, stacy, listen to me. human beings have empathy. some woman will fall in love. well, hes nice. he wears a sweater. he likes to bake, you know? he lets me finish my stories. which is all great qualities, okay, but you got to know, when you shack up with a guy like that, youre rolling the dice. youre rolling the dice that that fucking axe murderer is gonna pick the next house over, cause god forbid he picks your goddamn house, this is the dude who has your back, whos gonna be screaming louder and higher than you when this guy comes through the fucking door. and youre gonna turn around. all youre gonna see is his cowardly feet going out the kitchen window. i dont know, man, thats risky. you know, in reality, im being too hard on that guy. yeah, i am. i am, cause i was just as scared as he was. except i didnt scream out like he did, and thats simple. the simple reason was this dude, he was hugged too much as a child. having people going, how was your day? whats wrong? and all of that shit, you know? thats why i came down here. i came out here to tell you guys, you got to stop hugging your children. you are ruining this country. now you can hug your daughters, you got to do that, you got to do that. hug those hooker shoes right out of them, let them know that youre a good man, and to find another man like you. you got to do that. but your son, you can hug them a little bit, but every three, four, you got to fucking knock em down, right? come on, it didnt hurt, get up! i didnt come from a family, i dont know about you guys, i didnt come from a touchy-feely call me when you get there. mwah, mwah. none of that shit. first time my mom hugged me, i think, was like, once when i was little, and when i moved out. that was it! and we only hugged cause we knew we were supposed to. so we just tried to, like, it was like two parking meters came to life, like, we almost bumped heads. it was horrific. fucking horrific. to this day, sometimes i drive down the street, and i think about that hug, and its just so awful i have to like shout the memory out of my head. ill just be driving down the street, just be like aaaaah! anybody else like that? you ever have to shout stuff out of your head? theres something about me, like, all my regret comes up when im in the shower. i dont know what it is. i think cause im in the shower, and i have time to think, and ill just think of shit i did in third grade where i just made an ass of myself, and ill just be in the shower just being like [screaming] and my wifes always just like, is everything okay in there? ill just be like, yeah, yeah, just accidentally turned on the hot water. turned it on too much. every day? so yeah i actually asked my mother one time when i finally got out in the world, and i saw how other families interacted, i finally asked her, how come we never did the hugging thing? how come we didnt do that stuff? she was like, i wanted to hug you kids when you were little, but i was afraid it was gonna make you gay. and i was like, you were afraid? and s',\n",
       "  'he goes, well, it was your father. thats what it was. protecting him like i always do. he was afraid. he said, you dont know how to raise boys and if you hug them, thats whats gonna happen. so in a marriage, theres compromises. yeah, so she basically never hugged us, cause my dad said if she did, it was gonna make us gay. and i got to tell you, that was a great thing that my dad did for me. let me finish before you start blogging, okay? and i end up on a split screen on good morning atlanta. comedy, could it go too far? last night at the tabernacle– sitting there next to some fucking cheeto-eating blogger. so, yeah, this is the deal. im gonna defend my dad here because this is basically what happens when you have a kid. as far as i know. i dont have any kids. as far as id think, if you have a kid, what do you want to do? you want to improve on your childhood, okay? you want to keep the shit that your parents did that worked, and then you want to get rid of the stuff that didnt work. so that was my dad, as fucked up as that was, that was his improvement on his childhood that he never talks about, the way a veteran doesnt talk about going to war. so i figure if that was his improvement on his childhood, his childhood just must have been something like, dont change his shitty diaper. let him figure it out for himself. get out in the rain, you shitty baby! hey, let me handle this, lady! why are you still standing here, you shit toddler? so he took it from that and knocked it down to, dont hug him, its gonna make him gay. right? and then maybe someday i ever have a kid, ill whittle it down to like, hes not taking drama class, all right? hes not taking drama class cause i said so, lady! let me handle this! i wont fix everything. and thats not a homophobic thing either, that i wouldnt send my hypothetical son to drama class. okay? it isnt. i would send id let my hypothetical daughter take a drama class. okay. my son cant fucking do any of that shit unless im sending him to one of those fame high schools where everybodys doing it, one of those creative schools. you go to the cafeteria, everybodys like, ~ cottage cheese, what is it made of? ~ then he can do all he wants. then he can do all the fuck he wants, but theres no way im letting him do that at a public school with those goddamn animals! hes gonna get the shit kicked out of him! hes gonna come home with his underwear up his ass, and then i have to be the adult and go down to the principal and be like, theres some sort of tomfoolery going on around here! i dont want to do that. i want to find the fucking eight-year-old. what is he, this tall? i want to find the kid that did it to my kid, tip him upside down into some sand or a puddle, anywhere where oxygen is going to be an issue, right, and just leave him there. you wait for that one leg to start shaking so you know hes down to his last breath, and then you turn him upside-right, and you grab him by his throat, you say something horrific. you ever do that again, im gonna beat your mother to death with the family dog. all right? [applause] over. so yeah, a lot in my life has changed since i last came through here to atlanta. i got married. thats the big thing. yes, i did. very happy about that. im very happy because it was starting to get weird. its like  years old. my girlfriend, yeah, were gonna go out and get some pop. going to parties, it was just weird. cause i hang out with people my age, and they all got married, they all had kids. i just couldnt contribute when people were standing around talking about marriage marriages and kids. i felt like a little kid, just sitting there going like, the superintendent of the mayoral candidate will be bicoastal, bipartisan, with the middle eastern crisis, its just its an advanced learning program. the deadline is may . we have to stop the bullying with the superintendent of the mayoral candidate. when the conversation would come around to me, i felt like i was eight years old. id just be like, did anybody see the youtube video where the raccoon stole the cats food, and the cat was scratching him and the raccoon didnt care? he just came in like this, like george foreman, and then he reached out, he had hands. all of a sudden, he had hands. i didnt know they had hands. he scooped it up and he ran away on paws. did you guys know they had hands? so now im married, so the next move is youre supposed to have a kid, which i would love to do, but im  years old. im just thinking its too fucking late, ya know. come on, man, im gonna have a kid, im gonna die of natural causes when the kids in fifth grade. throwing him a frisbee. we used to use these on a saturday. do a face plant. my kids standing there, mom, dads sleeping again! i feel hopelessly behind. all my friends have kids. most of my friends who have kids are cool, but i got a couple of those who think now that they have a kid, that i dont understand anything anymore. you know those people? the most basic shit. hey, man, its kind of cold out today. dude, you dont understand. you dont understand cold till you got a two-year-old with a mitten up his ass and youre trying to get chocolate off the other ones face. all right, all right, i get it, you have a more complex life, but i still understand being cold, teeth chattering. kind of lets me know. right? mine just turned six. mine just turned seven. i just feel hopelessly behind. so what im actually thinking of doing, im thinking about adopting. yeah. absolutely, recycle. you know? think globally, act locally. everything doesnt have to be brand-new. you know? its like when you redo your kitchen. you got custom up top, you got ikea down the bottom, right? id love to adopt. its a great thing to do. but if i do it, im not telling any of my friends. im just gonna show up with the kid one day, just to piss em off. mine just turned six. mine just turned seven. id love to just show up with an eight-year-old, like, dominoes! yeah, now i get to tell you what you dont understand. seven-year-old? wait till they turn eight, eight is such a funny age. terrible twos? try the instant eights! bam! theyre just there, like! with all their issues! i should do it, though. i should adopt. i think its a great thing to do, and i already know what i want to get. i do. i want to get, like, an ,  always garaged, good dentition. do you know what i would l',\n",
       "  'ove to do? id love to rescue some kid that works in a sweatshop. wouldnt that be amazing? like, find the kid that made this shirt? just show up at the factory like, hey! come on, bring it in! bring it in, you little maniac! how you doing? youre going back to the states. l-shaped couch, flat screen tv. get in the car, the rest of you keep sewing, but you, youre coming home with me! yeah. dude, how easy how easy would that kid be to raise? after the hell hes been through, all i gotta do is let him sit down. i am immediately the greatest human being this kid has ever met. just bring him home. have a seat. hell be like, i get to sit down? yeah, lay down on the couch. hell be like, its like a cloud! its like a cloud! ill get him a bowl of fritos, put on cricket or soccer, one of those sweatshop sports. i dont know. the kid would love me. so thats my first draft pick. all right? coming out of the gate with that. in the second round, id probably get like an  boy soldier, ya know. yeah, shore up the offensive line. you gotta protect the blindside. thats how fucked up the world is, theres little boys out there fighting in wars. so thats a twofer. i can drag him out of that hell, give him something of whats left of his childhood, and, god forbid, if the dollar ever collapses, right? shit goes south, zombies take over, i got backup. everybody thinks im gonna be the problem, meanwhile, i got this sawed-off chuck norris standing next to me,  kills, confirmed fucking kills. theyre not stories! can make a flamethrower out of a vacuum cleaner and a toaster. you cant coach that, right? i got to be honest with you, i feel like id have to go easier on the discipline with the boy solider. i might be nuts, but i feel like i could come down on the sweatshop kid, right? i said get in there and clean up your goddamn room. im getting sick of this shit! goes for you too if you want. but you! youve been out of line all day, mister! dont even start that shit! dont even start that shit. you say that every time. yes, you do. every fucking time you say that. you know the answer. you want me to say it again? ill break it down to you. you know why it is? you want to know why? cause you sew. all right? yeah. you sew. dude, hes fucking killed people. do you understand that? no, he doesnt, he doesnt have to make his bed too. no, he doesnt. because he doesnt sleep in the bed, hes out in the bushes all night, talking to himself, freaking me the fuck out, all right? oh, fuck you, fuck you! he scares me too, he scares me too. dont even start that shit. you wanted a big brother, and i got you one. dont even start that shit, all right? all right, youre right. stop crying, stop crying. shouldnt have yelled at you. i just thought i could fucking bring him in, give him a couple of pop tarts, i figured hed chill out. fucking sitting there looking through his eyebrows, doing that full metal jacket shit. no, you cant give him back, it doesnt work that way. there he is, there he is! whats up, buddy? whats going on? we were just talking about you, just doing, like, a little surprise thing. you feeling all right? you feeling all right? youre not looking through those eyebrows, huh? everything okay? so i figure, uh i dont know if ill do it. maybe im too selfish. i have no idea. im all over the fuckin map. do you know what i want to do right now? i actually want to learn how to fly a helicopter, man. i do, thats my latest thing. you know why it is? its cause i live in los angeles. yeah, and its an absolute clusterfuck. when you go into land in that city, just look out the window, and just look at the complete lack of planning. theres not even zoning laws. theyll build, like, a skyscraper next to a house, next to a gun range, and then theres, like, a fucking daycare center. right? the city doesnt even work even when everything else works, so god forbid, the dollar collapses or some crazy shit happens, where you gonna go in a city like that? see, you guys are all right out here in atlanta. youre all right. i dont know, maybe in atlanta might be crazy. youre on the outskirts, youre fine. youre fine. you dont live in a desert. you slam your face in a birdbath, youre cool. drink that water for a good  days. l.a., theres nowhere to go. thats why i love the helicopter. dude, the helicopter is the ultimate fuck this, im out vehicle. all you gotta do is assess the situation. zombie coming up the street? fuck this! this looks safe. you just land it. you could sit there hovering. just sit there in a hover watching everybody getting killed, sitting up there eating cheese and crackers with the red stick. yeah, so i told my wife i want to fly a helicopter. shes just like, yeah, no. which i know that came from a place of love, but it still kind of annoyed me. just that she said that shit, then i was just gonna be like, oh, all right. thought i was gonna get to do that, but you said no, so there goes that. hey, what other dreams arent i gonna get to achieve? like, do you already know or are you waiting for me to ask? yeah, im still gonna do it, im just not gonna tell her. im just gonna go out and do it, pass the goddamn class, and when i get my license, im not going to tell her. im just gonna go out and buy a white silk scarf, and hang it by a nail in the living room. shes just gonna be like, what is that? what is that for? what does that mean? yeah, someday youll see, someday youll see. when the shit hits the fan, and youre freaking the fuck out, and im taking branches off some unforeseen helicopter. what is that? shut the fuck up and get in! now you guys think im bullshitting, im not. im serious. im % in on this. and ever since i got into it, im seeing helicopters everywhere. i never realized how many helicopters there were. driving down the street like henry hill looking up at them doing key bumps and shit. theyre after me! swear to god! im seeing stories about them! its just like that old advertising anecdote. i never realized how many mattress commercials there were out there until i needed a mattress, and then all of a sudden, theyre all over the place. and then i bought a mattress and then it all went away. its the same shit. i saw this story down in orange county. right? down in orange county, california. this guy gave helicopter tours for  years–  years without incident. hands the business off to his son, the american dre',\n",
       "  'am. i built it up for  years. here you go, son. make the family and the family name proud. all right, dad, i love you. all right? this poor kid, five days in, hes supposed to give a tour to a couple, only the dude shows up. the kid thought it was weird, but hes like, i need the money. i gotta give him a tour. right? so he takes this guy up. ten minutes into the tour, the dude fucking jumped out. yeah, five days in. five days in from the balloons and the cake. we love you, son. keep the family tree going. the traditional line. five fucking days later, this kid, he probably barely had the speech down. just sitting there, flying the helicopter. all right, if you look out the left side of the aircraft, thats orange county. theres over  miles of beaches there. put your seatbelt back on,  miles of beaches. was established as a county in . sir, please dont open the door. sir, what are you doing? sir, no, no. dont, dont, stop, no, no! what the fuck? what the fuck? oh, my god. oh, my god. oh, my god. what the fuck, what the fuck?! fuck! air traffic control: i dont know whos on this frequency, but you really need– somebody just jumped out of the fucking helicopter! five days in. so i read further into the story. turns out the guy who jumped out, he was  years old, terminally ill, he was in pain every day. they couldnt figure out what was wrong with him, and he had had enough. at that point, that guy immediately became a hero in my world. know what i love about him, not only did he make the decision, he didnt go out like some pussy, right? handful of pills, watching a romantic comedy, wrapped in an afghan that nana made. fuck that. guy went out like a man. take me up in a chopper, im looking at the land i love, and then im jumping out like a superhero. i loved it. yeah.

       "  'ves a fuck? my wife does that, i just sit there, i just start commentating. here she comes again, walking by the tv. she really must be mad. shes never body-slammed me once, ever. im not saying to be a dick. all right? im just saying, you got to keep them honest. every once in a while, you got to have a little pushback. hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. rest of the shit– im learning that about women. you just want to keep them calm. just keep them calm, like a rescue dog, right? just everythings cool, everythings cool, just, yeah, yeah, yeah, this is great, this is great, im having a great time. no, your friends are awesome, your friends are awesome, very interesting party. i am talking to people, im talking to people, i am having a good time here. thats what you do. you just do that enough, then when you bark back, you got a little something. heres an olive branch ive extended to her. its basically we fight a lot over television. ive kind of come her way, shes come my way. she watches a little bit of sports, i occasionally will watch a romantic comedy. which, i dont care, the nerds gonna fuck the cheerleader. ill watch it, right? i dont mind them, its an uplifting story. i just dont like the love scenes in romantic comedies. they creep me out. theyre just so fucking nice. its, like, missionary-style. theres candles. that stupid saxophone music. [imitates saxophone] it always goes down. like the saxophone implies the penetration, right? cause they cant show it. they got to make her this one-dimensional, this little angel. they ignore the other % of her sexuality. no hair-pulling, no ass-slapping, none of that shit. none of that taboo stuff of a womans sexuality. thats never brought up. that whole hold me down but let me up, but hold me down. choke me, but let me breathe, but kind of scare the shit out of me a little bit. i want to feel your power but i want to be safe, but let me know if you really wanted to. that whole fifty shades of rape, whatever the hell that is. yeah. i dont even pretend to understand it. i remember the first time a woman wanted to get me to choke her a little bit. i didnt even know what she was doing. i was just so psyched to be getting laid, i was like and she just kept taking my hand, and she kept putting it right here. i didnt know what she was doing. i thought she was testing my core strength or some shit. and finally, i was just like, what are you doing? she says, like, i dont know. i just kinda like, ya know. its like squeeze a little bit and kind of like squeeze it. why dont you want to do it? itll be fun. why dont i want to do it? i dont think i want a passed-out naked woman with my fingerprints all around her neck. having the cops show up. yeah, shes in here, officer. damndest thing, it was her idea. i swear to god, it was her idea! yeah, they always make it nice in those movies. the raciest thing theyll do is every once in a while, theyll kiss up against a wall. i guess women like walls. i didnt know that. a lot of up-against-the-wall kissing. oh, my god, its the wall. oh, my god! its supporting me, maybe hell support me, its a metaphor, i love it. yeah, i saw one the other night, they were doing that, and then out of nowhere, they started having sex up against the wall. im like, finally, something a little bit more interesting, right? but they were doing it standing up facing each other, missionary-style. arguably one of the most difficult positions there is, and they were doing it with little to no difficulty. all she did was lift her leg up like that, and that was it. he was off to the races. i ruined the movie for my wife. im like, that is fucking bullshit! bullshit. what does the guy have, like, a u-shaped dick? how is he doing anything? is he sticking it in her navel? did he grease up her thighs, to hell with her needs? like, if all shes gonna do is this, shes got to bring it up like an offsides call, if thats what shes doing. all right? if not, you got to make some adjustments. you just got to grab the other leg, you got to try to pick her up there, use these muscles. [screaming] maybe you could grab a doorjamb, drop down, try to come in, try to do that. dude, nobody can do that other than a porn star for longer than  seconds before theyre like, all right, this is ridiculous, okay? my calves are burning, i cant get nearly enough momentum to do any sort of damage. i can literally feel you getting on with your day with every pathetic attempt to try and rock your world. these guys in the movie, they have no problem banging away, then they pick them up like theyre not heavy. they start walking down, they see the bed, they just lay her down on the bed. dude, im not trying to be a dick, but every woman in here is heavy. yeah, youre heavy. youre an adult female! jesus christ, when do you stop picking up your kids? when theyre, like, five or six? get off of me! jesus christ. youre gonna throw out my back. go jump on your brother. an adult woman weighs  pounds, , all the way up to god knows what. and its not balanced weight. most of its in your thighs and in your ass. your heads hanging off trying to counterbalance. dude, when guys go to the gym, we dont put  pounds on one side and a buck- over here. fuckin yeah! yeah, its ridiculous. trying to carry a naked woman, its like trying to carry a half-filled waterbed mattress. youre, like, bumping into shit. when you see the bed, you dont walk to it, you slowly start picking up momentum. then she bounces off this mattress, hits the wall, slides down, the whole sex vibes ruined, and youre back to your sandwich in your pocket. all right, im out of time. you guys were awesome. thank you so much. thank you, thank you. i had a great time. ill see you next time. thank you.

[chuckles] i dont you know, ive never partied like a model. i have partied twice in my life. twice. like, really partied. ive had good nights out, but ive really partied twice. if you really party, and most people never experience this, its an amazing thing. it happens in vegas. it can only happen in vegas, and its gotta involve celebrity, right? im not famous, but the people around me were super famous, and i was at this party in the night club, and they took me in. and then theres the night club, but then theres the real night club out the back, which is, like, the size of this stage. its only a little room. and you go back there and you can just they encourage you to take drugs in the open, and youre just doing it off a key, [sniffs] and theyre going, no, dude. use the table. dont use your and i go, oh, oh. oh, sorry. um and its confusing at first, and then their security will drag women off that other night club into your room. just bring em in like, huh? and you can do this. you can go uh like that. and theyll drag these women away. it is the best thing youll ever do with your life. when you party that hard as a man, theres a lot of remorse cause you have to tip everyone a lot of money. you wake up in the morning with a terrible hangover, and you go to your friends. you go, oh, my god. we partied so hard last night. i spent $,. when a hot girl parties that hard, she wakes up in the morning and goes, oh, my god. we partied so hard last night. i made $,. and thats a vastly different emotion that i dont think women will never yeah, okay. this is the thing. in america, at the moment, theyre trying to raise the minimum wage to, i dont know, $ an hour or something like that, and whenever they bring up this argument, they always go, and still to this day, women only earn % of what men earn in the workplace. and of course, thats disgusting. how dare women earn so much? like a lot of things that i say tonight will be jokes that i dont actually mean, but this is something im really passionate about. women do not deserve to earn as much money as men in the workplace. im sorry. i [aud',\n",
       "  'ience whooping] im not being a misogynistic bastard, right? im not saying that women dont work as hard. im sure they do. im not saying they dont do as good a job. what im saying is they dont deserve to earn as much money as men. right? men need that extra % to buy meals and drinks and jim jefferies tickets and all that shit! [audience cheering] now im sure theres women in this room that are saying, oh, i pay for my drinks. i bought my own ticket. and dont think we dont appreciate the uglies, cause we do. right? we do. but theres little things in society that you cant change. men have extra expenses that youll never understand. theres holidays that are just for women. like valentines day is just for women. they say its for romantics. they say its for couples or something like that. its just for women. theres no man who gets excited by valentines day. theres no man that when he sees the valentines day decorations go up in the shopping mall, he goes, oh, valentines day is coming! valentines day is a mathematical equation that every man has in his head, and it goes like this, how much money do i have to spend today so that you wont act like a cunt? it doesnt stop there. mothers day! mothers day rocked around in my house when my son was six months old. my girlfriends first mothers day. and she went, oh, i wonder what ill get for mothers day. and i went, probably fucking nothing. hes got no money. hes six months old. what do you think hes gonna buy you? within an hour, her friends were over at the house, just by coincidence, telling me what a bad person i was and how important mothers day is to a new mum, you know? and so, i went and bought her a cappuccino machine cause i assumed thats what hank would have wanted her to have and i wrote a card. im not a bastard. i wrote a card. im right-handed. so i got my left hand. every new dad knows this. you get the crayon and you go, [imitating child] happy mothers day. love, hank. and i went, h-a-n and then i did the k back-to-front because hes a fucking moron. see, now i know theres people in the room, theyre thinking, well, fathers have fathers day. fathers day is bullshit. its fucking shit, fathers day. fathers day came around and my girlfriend went, what do you want for fathers day? and i went, i dont want anything. dont even worry about it. i dont want anything. and she goes, come on. you gotta have something. i said, honestly, i dont want anything. and she goes, come on. and i went, its my fucking money. just dont touch it. just leave my money alone. how hard is this? how about, for  hours, you dont touch my fucking money? that would be a gift. thats why every single father has that one fathers day gift that they cherish, and its shit! its, like, a fucking ceramic mug that the kid made in school where the handles too big, and it says, i heart dad. and they keep that for  fucking years, this mug. and do you wanna know why they like it? every now and again, they look at it and go that cost me nothing, that mug. [audience whooping] see wouldnt it be nice to have one day that was for men and for fathers and all that type of stuff, but didnt cost anything, that everyone could participate in, right? ive got it, right? april  anal sex day. [men cheering loudly] its good, isnt it? everyones girlfriend or wife has to take it in the ass on april . its nice. a month before, youd be walking around the shopping center going, oh, the decorations are up! [men whooping] and its good cause if your bird didnt take it in the ass, you could do the same thing that women do on valentines day when they dont get a gift. you could go like, oh, me mate, jason, his wife took it in the ass twice. yeah, obviously, theyre more connected than we are. theyve, uh im thinking, i dont do much merchandise after my shows and stuff, but im thinking of bringing out some april  t-shirts. not even putting jim jefferies on them or anything. just t-shirts that say, april . cause its good, right? youre in a bar. youre a guy. you see a guy at the other end of the bar with an april , and you go fucking friends for life, right? but even better, you see a girl with an april  t-shirt. the weird thing is im bigging-up anal sex here, and i dont even really like fucking girls in the ass that much. im not even a huge fan. i much prefer the cunt. i think its a much more i think that a cunt is a much more purpose-built thing to fuck. but, you know, anal sex oh, you know i do it. i get involved, cause i feel like i have to. you know, i but ive never been a big fan of the ass fucking, i, uh when i watch it on porn, it seems very inviting. the girls taking it so fluently in her ass, and she seems to be having fun, and, uh but the thing is, you cant smell porn. you dont smell porn. you just you just watch it. they never and its different, porn. its different. they clean the girls asshole. they pump water into it until its very hygienic. im sure. and the girl seems to be so happy. shes like youve got it in her pussy, youre fucking her, and then shes like, put it in my ass. shes inviting. its like youre doing her a favor in porn. and then shes like she says things i dont know, things like, im enjoying that. keep putting it in my ass. fuck my ass. i love a cock in my ass. and and the experience ive had in my own life has been vastly different. ive my experience has been a lot of crying. now, although that can help you come at times, its not what you want its not what you want for every day. i like the girl who acts like shes enjoying it. like, you know when your girlfriends like, im gonna act like i enjoy it. she does that whole, yeah. oh, no, thats good. [moaning] ahh! ♪ im having a good time ♪ and then theyre always going, are you done? are you close to done? you never fuck a',\n",
       "  ' pussy and they go, are you almost done? finish this. like that. if youre fucking ass, they dont want you they want it all over, quick. and they do other things, the porn girls. i dont know how much they get paid. im sure its more than what the men get paid. its the opposite bit of society. um but they do a thing called atm. i dont know if you know what that is, kids. that stands for ass to mouth. thats where the porn girl will pull the cock from out of her anus, and shell put it directly in her mouth, and shell say something like, i love the taste of my ass. let me taste my ass. and then the man, as a favor to this woman, puts his cock in her mouth to congratulate her on the fine work [applause] shes been doing. now, i had a drunken night with my ex-girlfriend where she thought shed be all wild and try that. once again, vastly different experience. im not a big fan of the ass fucking, and i dont know of any man, if theyre truthful, really is. now, theres women in the room who are thinking, well, why does my guy constantly bother me to fuck me in my ass? [woman shouting] what a good question. [woman whoops] women, the reason that men like fucking you in the ass is because we know you fucking hate it. [cheering] so im a father. um i love my son! i love my son the same way that i love cigarettes. i like to hold him for five minutes every hour, and the rest of the time, im thinking about how hes fucking killing me. hes a good little boy. no, hes a great little fella. i really like him. um my girlfriend super loves him, though. its fucking creepy. and im glad i have a son. that worked out good for me. i wouldnt be a good father to a girl. it wouldnt be good for me. nothing weird. wouldnt fuck it. i i just dont get along with women. you know how it is. i dont want them in my house, and so because you dream, see for example, okay? when hank was born the couple over the road, within two weeks of hank being born, had a baby girl, and rightly or wrongly, the first thing that went through my head was aw, thats great. i hope hank fucks that one day. thats what i think cause thats what i think about my son. i hope when hes of age, he just fucks everything. i dont care if my son is gay or straight. all i care about is, when he is of age, that he gets every bit of fucking pussy or cock that he desires. that is my dream for my son! [audience cheering] but never in the history of fathers and daughters, has a father held his baby girl and gone, oh, i hope you have a lot of cocks through you in your life. i hope youre never shy of a cock. i hope you pass out at parties and all the boys are queuing up. right, you know and its not just me. women treat baby girls and baby boys differently as well. my girlfriend goes to the gym every morning. i go there very occasionally, and when you go to the gym, theres a little daycare crèche thing in the gym where you can hand your child off, and inside that daycare, theres, like, three women in their . theyre very nice ladies, and you hand your kid off and he plays. then when you finish your workout, you come and get him. and theres a woman that works there who just loves my son. she sees all the other kids, but she loves hank, and hank fucking loves her, and the two of them light up when they see each other. and its super cute, i bring hank up the stairs, and he starts going, uh, uh! trying to reach at her, all right? and she does this, she goes, everyone, my boyfriends here. heres my boyfriend. give him here. hes my boyfriend. and then she kisses him, and she goes, ♪ my boyfriend gives me kisses my boyfriend gives me kisses ♪ its fucking adorable. but i tried doing that with a baby girl lets say you go to the gym and theres a daycare, and me and a couple of my mates are working there. hey, everyone me girlfriends here. give her here. give her here. shes my girlfriend. my girlfriend gives me kisses. you know that, right? shes always giving me kisses. enjoy your workout. dont worry about a thing. [applause] [cheering] so also its just easier to bring up a son than it is a daughter. its just little things. even when theyre babies, its just easier. theres a wiping technique when youre wiping a babys ass. i dont know if you have children, but this is how you do it. the baby lays on its back. you put their feet together. you lift the feet up, and then you go in and wipe. with a boy, you can wipe like that. up and down, side to side, whatever the fuck you want, right? with a girl, you gotta wipe downward and away. downward and away. its very important that you wipe away from the cunt. very important. cause it turns out that women of all ages hate having shit in their cunts. they do. they fucking hate it. boys dont give a shit. fucking my son will have shit all over his dick and balls, and ill be cleaning it off under the foreskin, and hell be laughing like its the best day ever. even at my age now, i find it funny if i have shit on my dick. if i fuck my girlfriend in the ass, i pull out, ive got shit on my dick, ill ring me mate jason up and go, hey, jason its happened again. i got shit on my dick. and hell tell me a similar story about when he had shit on his dick, and well laugh and laugh and laugh. but never in the history of women has there been a woman with shit in her cunt and shes thought, oh, i cant wait to call karen. [chuckles] [laughs] when you when my girlfriend got pregnant when you meet when you havent got a child, couples who have children are always bragging about how cool it is to have children. whenever you meet couples with children theyre always like, it is the most fulfilling thing ive ever done with my life. my heart grows larger and larger every day. and then the second that my girlfriend got pregnant, those same people we',\n",
       "  'nt like this, youre never gonna sleep again! [laughs maniacally] forget about it. its over. youre not gonna sleep. theyre constantly telling you youre not gonna sleep. raising a baby is not that hard. ill tell you what, its easier than a coke habit. i had a coke habit for seven-and-a-half fucking years! at least its not me who wakes up crying anymore! i can sleep through other people crying. ive had girlfriends. thats like white noise to me. i find it soothing. see, me and my girlfriend, just two months, we went, fuck it! lets have a kid. fucking did it, right? these other people, man you know these couples, and they date from high school, and then they go out for a bit longer, and then after being together for like, seven years, they go, were getting engaged. you wanna come to the party? and you wanna say, no, youre really boring and we hate you. but you go, oh, okay, great. youre still together, are you? you fucked one person, have you? oh, how exciting. and and then what they do is they dont have a kid right away because theyre still not ready. we have to see how our careers are going and shit. and what they do is they get a dog, and then they act like the fucking dogs their baby. they refer to it as their fucking baby. they send you a christmas card of them holding the dog and it says, from our family to yours. and then you have a barbecue, and you invite them, the humans, right? then they come over. this fucking dog runs in, jumping over everything, and youre like, what the fuck is this shit? and theyre like, we had to bring him. we bring our baby everywhere. and you go, well, your baby is biting my actual baby. can you control and then, eventually, they decide theyre gonna have a kid cause theyve learned so much from the dog, and then they bring the kid back, and the dog runs up, like, whats happening? a new person. and theyre like, fuck off. we dont love you anymore. were going. and they think theyve learnt something from the dog, and they havent learnt anything. what happens if your girlfriends away on work and the dog dies? you go off, you buy another dog that looks similar to the original dog try to pass it off as the same dog. what happens if your girlfriends away on work and the baby dies? very hard to get a baby that looks exactly the same in the short period of time that you have. easier if youre black or asian. [audience cheering] boston, no! no! no! shut up! i will not put up with racism at my shows, okay? im not saying cause they look the same. im saying cause theyre easier to purchase. [audience cheering] [audience whooping] if angelina jolie and madonna have taught us anything it is that you can buy black and asian people. im yet to see a black celebrity couple come home from norway with a child, going yolanda, quick, get hans. bring him over. come on. [jeffries chuckles] im gonna talk about something now that sort of splits the crowd a little bit. uh gun control. now no, wait. before you dont get excited because the other people have guns. the anti-gun people are like, yeah! do it, jim! no, lets just [shushes] now, before i start saying this, i wanna say this, right? i believe in your right as americans to have guns. im not trying to stop you from having guns. all im saying is this is my personal belief on the opinion. my opinion on the oh, it doesnt matter. i dont like guns, right? im gonna say some things that are just facts, right? in australia, we had guns, right? right up until . in , australia had the biggest massacre on earth. it still hasnt been beaten. and now, after that, they banned the guns. now, in the  years before port arthur, there was  massacres. since the gun ban in , there hasnt been a single massacre since. i dont know how or why this happened, uh maybe it was a coincidence, right? now, please understand that i understand that australia and america are two vastly different cultures with different people, right? i get it. in australia, we had the biggest massacre on earth, and the australian government went, thats it! no more guns! and we all went, yeah, all right, then. that seems fair enough, really. now, in america, you had the sandy hook massacre where little, tiny children died, and your government went, maybe well get rid of the big guns? and % of you went, fuck you! dont take my guns! [whooping] so, heres where it gets confusing, right? now, as i said, i am all for your second amendment rights. i think you should be able to have guns. its in your constitution. what i am not for is bullshit arguments and lies. there is one argument and one argument alone for having a gun, and this is the argument fuck off. i like guns. its not the best argument, but its all youve got. and theres nothing wrong with it. theres nothing wrong with saying, i like something. dont take it away from me. but dont give me this other bullshit. the main one is, [in american accent] i need it for protection. i need to protect me. i need to protect my family. really? is that why theyre called assault rifles? is it? ive never heard of these fucking protection rifles you speak of. protection? what the fuck are you talking about? you have a gun in your house, youre % more likely to use that gun on yourself, than to shoot someone else. and people think, well, thatd never happen to me. you dont know that, because you know what?\\n♪ from time to time we all get sad ♪ \\n♪ one day youre happy then youre sad ♪ \\n♪ and then, uh-oh ♪\\nprotection. i had a break-in in manchester, england, where i was tied up, i had my head cut. they threatened to rape my girlfriend. they came through the window with a machete and a hammer, and americans always go, [in american accent] well, imagine if you had a gun. and im like, all right. i was naked at the time. i wasnt wearin',\n",
       "  \"g my holster. i wasnt staring at the window waiting for cunts with machetes to come through. what world do you live in where youre constantly fucking ready? you have guns cause you like guns! thats why you go to gun conventions! thats why you read gun magazines! none of you give a shit about home security. none of you go to home security conventions. none of you read padlock monthly. none of you have a facebook picture of you behind a secure door going, fucking yeah! like youre going to be ready if someone comes into your house. you have it at all fucking times. by the way, most people who are breaking into your house just want your fucking tv! you think that people are coming to murder your family? how many fucking enemies do you have? jeez, you think a lot of yourself if you think everyones coming to murder you. see, if you have it readily available, it becomes unsafe. you have it in your bedside table, one of your kids picks it up, thinks its a toy, shoots another one of your kids. happens every fucking day, but people go, thatd never happen in my house cause im a responsible gun owner. i keep my guns locked in a safe. then theyre no fucking protection! someone comes into the house, youre like, wait there, fuck-face! oh! youve come to the wrong house here, buddy boy. i tell you what. im gonna fuck you up! okay. is it  to the left or  to the right? your mothers birthday? why the fuck would i know your fucking mothers birthday? maybe if you didnt leave the window open [in whining voice] because its too hot in here, we wouldnt be getting fucking murdered, right? i find the nra to be hard work. the fact that they always think the answer is more guns. after sandy hook happened, the nra said, and i quote, none of this would have happened if the teachers had guns. i i think theyre forgetting what school was like. does anyone remember that casual teacher that used to whenever she came into school, that relief teacher came, you and your friends would see her and go, [chuckling] oh, were gonna make her cry. and then shed stand in front of the class with a bit of chalk and her hands would be shaking, and youd go, youre never getting married, are you, miss? never gonna happen for you. then shed get back to her  volkswagen beetle, and shed be crying over the steering wheel, just, why dont they like me? lets give that cunt a gun and see how things work out! [audience cheering] and then they go, oh, well, answer to that, well just add more guns. they go, well put an armed security guard at every school across america. yeah, thatll work out. the average security guard in america earns $ an hour. not a lot of wiggle room to be a fucking hero! someone comes onto the school and [mimicking machine gun] and youve got kevin. now, im sure kevins shit-hot at call of duty, but it might not fucking cut it, ladies and gentlemen. now, i understand that when im doing this joke in this room, % of you agree with me, % of you dont agree with me, and i do respect the people who dont agree with me. dont think i dont. out of the % that dont agree with me, % of those people are smart enough to realize this is a comedy show and its not to be taken seriously, and theyre laughing along cause its just funny jokes, right? and then the next %, have sort of phased out a little bit. theyre looking around, going, wonder how they got that chandelier up there? and then theres the last %. and theyre fucking furious. right now, in this room and the people watching at home % of you are fucking seething. just and for a couple of reasons. first reason, im making good points. [audience cheering] second reason. second reason. second reason, and this is the big one, im foreign and thats pissing the fuck out of you right now, and your brain is on a loop and you cant fucking turn it off, and its just going around in a circle, and youre just going, if you dont like it, go home! if you dont like it, go home! and my answer to that is, no. i came here legally. i pay my taxes. ill say whatever the fuck i want. your first amendment means that i can say the second amendment sucks dicks. and unless youre an american indian, youre a fucking immigrant as well, so fuck off. people get so precious about it. i understand that to americans, your constitution is very important. i respect it, but please understand that every country has one as well. its no more special than any other constitution. we have one in australia. i dont know what it says. ive never seen it. if theres a problem, well check it, but everythings going fine. and dont get me wrong. i get that the constitution is important to you. i have had fucking, i get it, right? ive had people come up to me in my face and scream at me in car parks as im leaving the theater, going, [in american accent] you cannot change the second amendment! and im like, yes, you can. its called an amendment.' if you cant change something thats called an amendment, see, many of you need a thesaurus more than you need a constitution. and if you dont know what a thesaurus is, get a dictionary and work your way forward. dont think your constitution is set in stone. youve changed things before. you used to have prohibition in there, right? and then people were like, hey, who likes getting fucked up? yeah, i like getting fucked up, too. lets get that one out. lets get that one out. you used to have this other thing in america called, uh slavery! and then lincoln came along and went, thats it. no more slaves! and % of you went, fuck you! dont take my slaves! and the same bullshit arguments came out that you have with guns. why should i have my slaves taken off me? im a responsible slave owner. im trained in how to use my slaves safely. just because that guy mistreated his slaves doesnt mean t\",\n",
       "  'hat my rights should be taken away from me. i i use my slaves to protect my family! i keep my slaves locked in a safe! thats the thing. why should i have my guns taken off me? ive done nothing wrong. look, i agree with you. if youre a responsible gun owner and you dont fuck around with them, then you should be allowed your guns. you really should. but thats not how society works. we have to play to the % that are such fuckwits they ruin it for the rest of us. we have to walk as slow as our slowest person to keep society fucking moving, right? i take drugs like a fucking champion, right? [audience cheering] we should all be allowed to take fucking drugs, but we cant, can we? because sarah took drugs and she stabbed her fucking kids. oh! oh, thanks, sarah. you fucked it up for everyone. right? everyone should be allowed to drive their car as fast as they can do it, right? but we cant because jonathan got drunk and ran over a family. thanks, jonathan! now i have to drive at , you fucking idiot! see, thats the thing. why should i have my guns taken off me, im responsible, just because that guys crazy? whos to say youre not crazy? thats the thing about crazy people. they dont know theyre crazy. thats what makes them crazy. the only thing you know for sure on this earth is, i think, therefore i am. you know that you exist. anything past that is open to interpretation, right? you know you exist and thats it. right now, i think im in boston talking to , people. thats what i think im doing, but there is a good to fair chance that im in a mental home, standing in front of a white wall, going, [slurring speech] i hate guns. i hate guns. i hate guns. [audience applauding] see, one of the better arguments is, well, if you take the guns away, then only the criminals will have guns. not true. when they banned the guns in australia, it worked. when they banned them in britain, it worked, okay? the bushmaster gun that the kid was gonna use in sandy hook costs, like, $, american and you can buy it in walmart. itll be delivered to your house. thats it, man. , bucks, right? that same gun in australia on the black market costs $,. now if you have $,, you dont need to be a criminal. youve got $,. youre a great little saver. keep going. so that covers the criminals, but that doesnt cover the people who wanna murder your family, that are coming after you and your family. it kind of does. the people who do the massacres, it covers them cause they go the kid at colorado who thought he was the joker, lets say that he had some social issues. the kid at sandy hook was aspergers as fuck. right? i dont know if you know a lot about the black market, but you cant just rock up at the docks going, [slurring speech] guns! who wants to sell me a gun? now, im gonna wrap this up. we wont talk about it anymore. now see, the one thing that i do really agree with with the right to bear arms, i really agree with that the real reason it was written was so that you could form a militia to fight against a tyrannical government. in case the government became a bunch of cunts, you could all get your guns and fight back, and thats why it was written. – [audience cheering] – yeah! and that made a hell of a lot of sense when it was just muskets. but you do know the government has drones, right? you get that? youre bringing guns to a drone fight! if we went back to muskets, im all for it! keep the second amendment. if we all have muskets muskets are awesome! every cunt should be carrying a musket with him at all times. you know whats good about the musket? it gives you a lot of time to calm down. someone calls your wife fat, and youre like, fuck you, buddy! ah, youre not a bad guy. youre all right. now after the show, were gonna go out, have a big party around boston, see how it goes. im not allowed to go to strip clubs anymore. my girlfriend has said thats a no cause i dont behave myself in there, so im not allowed to go to them anymore. cause strip clubs arent what women think they are. [stammers] it used to be like okay, so, when a man goes to a strip club, its all about girls being as dirty and as horrible to each other as possible. thats what men want to see. women, when they go to their magic mike clubs or whatever the fuck they are women wanna see a guy, hey, ladies. hes a fireman. and he comes out with his hose and like that and whenever a stripper takes their clothes off, theyve still got the firemans hat on or a tool belt on or policemans gun on a holster, right? because even when a mans naked, a woman wants to know that he has a job. when men watch strippers, we want them to have a job, and that jobs stripping. we want to just look at that girl dancing and have a hand full of money, and just go you cant take care of your kids. its and when men get private dances in these strip clubs, i dont know i dont know if women actually know what goes on in those rooms, but basically, its dry humping. theres no dancing. the girl gets in front. she gets where your cock is, pushes it to one side and then she rubs on it and then she stands over and puts her cunt right in your face, and you go thats what a private dance is, right? i dont know if theres private dancing in female strip clubs. [stammering] i cant imagine that there would be. i dont imagine a woman getting out of a back room and going up to her friend and going she goes, how was it? and she goes, well he just sat me down and then he grabbed my genitals and then he dragged his scrotum over my forehead. i got to go to the atm. so legit got canceled. [audience booing] yeah. i know. i know it. who wouldve thought it wouldve struggled on that great fxx channel that everyone knew about? the first season is on netflix. this special is being recorded for netf',\n",
       "  'lix. so you can go watch it there if youre watching the special. it was im very proud of it. we had two great seasons of really good television, and if people didnt now the whole tv show is based around one standup routine that i used to do about having a friend with muscular dystrophy that i took to a brothel, which is a true story. and so, when we cast a character with muscular dystrophy who in the end, we used dj qualls, and dj qualls is the skinny white guy out of the movie road trip. hes the skinny white guy out of the movie hustle & flow, and hes the white guy out of the movie hustle & flow. now the great thing about dj is he already looks disabled. he has that latter stages of aids thing going on. its great for casting. anyway, but i didnt want dj to begin with. i wanted a person with muscular dystrophy to make it look authentic, and the actors union of america said, you cannot do that. because basically the problem is people with muscular dystrophy, i think, are only allowed to work for two hours a day before they get too tired. and i said, all right, what other disabilities and diseases are allowed to work longer? and they sent me a list. and on this list, i said, can you get rid of all the contagious ones? and what have we got left? so i saw every disabled actor in hollywood, and ill be honest with you, not that many of them. i dont know why. maybe theyre just lazy. they dont wanna work. maybe they give up on their dreams rather quickly. and none of them were very good, either. everyone we saw, none of them were very good cause acting is all about what you do with your hands. none of them knew what to do with their hands, and they all came in. until this one guy came in. i had seen a lot of people that day. this guy was the most disabled person id ever seen in my life. he was like think of the most disabled person youve seen, then double it. really super disabled. he was shaped like a pretzel. he was being carried in by this big russian nurse, carried him in. he made that great disabled sound of [groans] that one. i just loved him. anyway so he comes in for the audition and im sitting there, and were doing the lines together, and at first, i didnt know if he was mentally all there either, so i was being a little bit patronizing. i was going, thank you so much for coming in. and then we did the dialog together, and i didnt have to worry about a thing. this kid was funny. he was smart. his timing was impeccable. i thought he was just great, and i helped him out of the room, and i come back to the director and i said, thats our guy. thats who we gotta pick. and he agreed, but we had to see everyone else who was still in the waiting room. so the next bloke wheels himself in. now, obviously, hes just a paraplegic if hes wheeling himself in, which means the waist down, and that didnt really suit me because paraplegics can get themselves to a hooker without my assistance. but i thought if hes a good enough actor, maybe he can quad-up for the role. so he comes in he comes in, i shake his hand, and his leg slightly comes out at the same time. and i went, whoa! whats going on there, kicky? and he goes oh, you got me! im not disabled. and i said, youre fucking what now? and he goes, im not disabled. i just really wanted the role, so i rented a wheelchair. and i said, just shut up. so let me this is how your day has mapped-out thus far. you woke up this morning. you drove to the wheelchair rental place. you rented a wheelchair. you carried it out, i assume. you put it in the trunk of your car. you drove here. you got the wheelchair out. you carried it up three flights of stairs. you went to the waiting room. you put it down next to the severely disabled man and his nurse. then you sat in it and practiced your lines. and he went yeah. and i said, youre a fucking asshole, mate. get the fuck out of here. and i kicked him out. and later on that day, im sitting there with all the headshots of all the different actors im gonna call to tell them theyve got parts, and im holding this disabled guys headshot, and i just think, im gonna call this guy up. im gonna change his life. this is an awesome moment, right? and im looking at it, and he looks super handsome in his headshot. he looked really like and i thought, this has gotta be the greatest photographer with the fastest shutter in camera history. the shutter on his camera has gotta be like [mimicking camera shutter] like [audience applauding] and then i read the guys biography and then it dawned on me. this guys not disabled either! i hated the other fucker for renting a wheelchair! this cunt rented a nurse! do you wanna know the level of fucking psychosis you have to go through to rent a fucking nurse? im all for a method actor. get into character three hours before, but once you finish the audition, stand up and go, ta-da! and we would have gone, that was very good. but ill tell you what you dont do. dont make me carry you to your car! i carried him down three flights of stairs going, you did very good. hes like, thank you, jim. [laughing] [chuckles] i was, uh i go to a therapist cause i get depressed. so i got a therapist every now and again. i literally had one of those moments with my therapist where she was saying words like, im gonna say a word and you say the first thing that comes in your mind. like just out of the movies, right? and she went, red, and i went, blue. and then she went, cooking, and i went, food, and all that type of stuff. we went like this forever. and then she went for the last question, she went, and whats your favorite thing in the world? and i went coming on a girls face. now now, i couldve said things like ice cream is a good answer. hank wouldve been an excellent answer. but i said, c',\n",
       "  'oming on a girls face. and ive had six months to think about my answer, and i stand by it. – i – [cheering] im not proud of it. i hate myself for thinking it. its such a horrible thing to do to another human. when a girls on her knees and you its so and as an atheist, i believe in darwin and all the things that he wrote, but he never had a bit where he explained that. there was never a bit in his book where he went, when a caveman loves a cavewoman, hell ejaculate on her face so that flies wont come near. there was never that never that moment. but, by golly, if its not fun. i find it to look, to all the girls who take a load on their face from time to time, may i say, bravo! dont dont think what you do has gone unnoticed. we notice. we appreciate your work. i think you deserve a parade of some kind. during memorial day, after the vietnam vets, before the first gulf war guys, we could bring in, and heres the women who take a load on their face. and you could march out, and married men would stand there going, god bless you, ladies. [audience cheering] i enjoy your acting that you do. the standard tongue out and the like that i dont know why, but i enjoy i know its a lie. i know youre not excited, but i still appreciate the effort is what i enjoy. i love the look because its such a, oh, jeez, im excited, too. when this come hits my face, theres a good chance ill also orgasm. anything could happen in this crazy world. but this is what redeems us as men. this is what redeems us. just know that the second the come shoots out of our cock and hits your face, our bodies flood with remorse. the next  seconds is the nicest we will ever be to you. [men whooping] i go from being an animal to the sweetest guy on earth. im like, you fucking slut oh, i love you. ah uh, all right. no, no, no. put your tongue back in. um keep your eyes shut. just keep them shut. uh all right, im going to get a towel. ill get a towel. ill get you a towel. all right. youre a wonderful mother to our child. [laughs] [audience cheering] see this is what kills me. my son will one day watch this dvd. and im the guy whos meant to teach him right from wrong, and im there wiping come off his mothers face. i think i did something illegal with my son the other day. i think it might be illegal. tell me if this is illegal. all right? im in the shower. my girlfriend goes off to the gym in the morning, and when she came back, i was in the shower, and hank ran up, and he started banging on the glass door of the shower like, argh! like that. and i went [vocalizing] and i saw his little face and i went, hello, hankie. and then in the condensation, i drew a little bowtie on him and a little suit and then i gave him a voice bubble that said, i love my daddy. love, hank. but i did it so i could read it. well, of course he could read the k, and then i stepped out. i stepped out of the bathroom and i went, gday, hankie! and he slapped my cock and he ran off. now, is that illegal? i dont know. is it illegal because, a, a child touched my cock, or because, b, i found it really funny and ive been telling everyone. and i cant get angry at him because his whole life, hes been lying on mats with things dangling over. hes been training for this his entire life. i think ive, uh i think ive become american, more american than i am australian lately, and there was a moment where i tipped over where i went, oh, i think like an american person now. and im happy to do it. i just ill tell you what happened. i was flying around i was doing a tour of australia, and i was flying domestically around australia, and im so used to airports and stuff here in america that okay, what happens is, when you go i was flying sydney to melbourne. when you fly domestically in australia, you go up to the machine, put your name in, prints your ticket out, it prints your bag thing, you put the bag thing on your bag yourself, and then theres a conveyor belt underneath. you throw your bag on. bag fucks off. you dont speak to anyone. then i go up to the gate bit, and the ladys going, tickets, please. and im holding my id out like a fucking simpleton. cause i get through airports quick, man. im like, fucking there you go. and she went, put your id away. i dont need to see that. and i went i think you do. and she went, i dont why would i need to see your id? and i said, i might be a terrorist. and she went, would showing me your id stop you from blowing the plane up? no, id probably still blow the plane up. so then i get up to the tsa conveyor belt thing, and im so good at the airports. im already taking my shoes off as im walking, right? and all the australians behind me assume that im american, and theyre losing their fucking shit. theyre like, oh, for fucks sake! one of these cunts, eh? and the tsa guy goes, hey, mate, what are you taking your shoes off for? and i went [shouting] i dont know! maybe theyre bombs? and he went but theyre not, are they? i put me shoes back on. i get my laptop out. everyones going mental. and the tsa guy says, very politely, but extraordinarily sarcastically, he goes, jeez, mate. thats a nice computer. why are you showing it to everyone? it might also be a bomb. and then the guy said the most australian thing ive ever heard come out of anyones mouth ever. he went oh, come on, mate. you wouldnt have two bombs. [audience laughing] [chuckles] im not even quite sure what that means, but it does make some type of sense. all right. oscar pistorius. if you havent been following the case, youre missing out. this is the greatest thing since oj simpson. youre fucking missing out, mate. if you dont know who oscar pistorius is, let me fill you in. oscar pistorius is a legless man from south africa, known as the blade runner. he ran ',\n",
       "  'in two olympics, the disabled and the able-bodied olympics in one year. no one has ever done that. hes an inspiration to hundreds and millions of disabled and able-bodied people alike, and on valentines day last year, he shot and killed the hottest girl on earth and thats when he became an inspiration to me cause hot girls have been getting away with too much shit for too fucking long. let that be a lesson to all you hot girls out there. you cant just say whatever the fuck you want whenever you fucking want. [mock tearfully] people have feelings, you cunts. now, theres a lot of rumors going around on what happened on that day. one of the theories is that they found in her phone he went through her phone, and on her phone, he found some text messages from a south african rugby player on valentines day, right? now, i dont know if youve ever been to south africa, but in south africa, rugby is more popular than legless running. it goes, rugby, legless running, cricket. legless runnings their second sport. you wouldnt have thought that. anyway im going to reenact what i believe happened that day. to do that, i will now be doing a south african accent. now i know, many of you cant tell the difference between my accent and a south african accent. heres the difference. picture my accent, but im punching a black person. what im trying to say is south africans are horrible people. so shes coming out of the shower. shes been drying her hair. shes listening to rodriguez or something. she comes out. hes laying on the bed. he looks up at her, hes holding the phone, and he goes, [in south african accent] what the fuck is this? ive been through your phone. you have been texting a rugby player. and shes like, oh! fuck you! who the fuck do you think you are? who am i? im oscar pistorius, the greatest legless runner that has ever been. thats who the fuck i am. well, i would rather be with a rugby player. at least he is a whole man, not a three-quarter man like you. – [audience exclaiming] – i know. [audience laughing] oh! fuck you! no! fuck you! im leaving you! and then she storms out of the room, and then he was like you fucking bitch! [grunts] i hate you! [grunting] you will rue the day that you left oscar pistorius, the blade runner! dont go anywhere! [grunting] i hate you! thats where he keeps his legs. all right. then he put the blades on. oh, youre in trouble, missy. i tell you. i go to my gun safe. she locked herself in the bathroom. he shot her through the bathroom door. seems like overkill, doesnt it? bathrooms only have little tiny locks on them, but oscars one of the few men on earth that couldnt kick the door in, right? he was wearing the blades, so boing! ah! so i think oscar will probably go to prison. now in south africa, one in four people have aids. i assume it may even be worse in the prison population. now, can i say this? look ive never raped a man. i hate that i have to put a man in that sentence, but whatever. ive never raped a man, but if i was going to rape a man, it would be a legless olympian cause in prison, its all about getting one up on other people, and making people think youre tough and all that. like, you want to fucking rape me? i just raped an olympian, bitch. is that what you fucking want? thered be a wonderful moment when youre in the showers and he was crawling away like the end of a terminator movie. [chuckling] you know what i like about that joke? so often when you tell a joke, the rapist is the villain in the story, but not in that one. not in that one. hes the hero. all right, we have to get going soon. before i leave, – i thank you very much for coming. – [audience groaning] no, i said, soon, not over. its just soon, you cunts, so calm down. [chuckles] [man whistles] i always i always find that weird when someone, like, whistles like that. what do they think is going to happen? like, im going to go, fucking you know me, mate. i was enjoying claps and cheers, but what i needed was a high-pitched squeal noise. thank god you came along to pick up my spirits. [man] love you! all right, final story. now, i was in south africa again. jeez, i dont think ill be working in south africa after this special comes out. i used to do, like, one tour in south africa every year, and i just dont know if ill be invited this time. theyll be like, [in south african accent] we dont like him. hes no good. anyway, so, im in south africa, and i had to fly back from cape town to los angeles, which is, like, a -hour flight. youve to go up to london and go across. cunt of a trip. um but it was all right cause i had a business class ticket, so i didnt give a fuck. and when i travel economy, i try to dress up nice cause i like to look good in case someone recognizes me and i might get an upgrade. but when ive already got a business class ticket, i try to look like a bag of shit cause its important to me that everyone else in business class doesnt want me there and theyre annoyed by my presence. so im wearing a white t-shirt thats got brown stains on it with a hole in the side. im wearing these small shorts with just one testicle hanging out. so, anyway, i go up to the counter, up to the business thing with the thing, and i go, hello, and the lady goes, [in south african accent] oh, mr. jefferies, im so sorry, but you have been downgraded. i said, you what now? she goes, business class is full. you have been downgraded. and i said, i understand that business class is full. i bought one of the tickets that made it full. and she went, im sorry, sir. theres nothing i can do. and then i just went, are you fucking kidding me? now, you know when youre dealing with customer service people, and they want you to swear, cause as soon as you swear, they dont have to engage ',\n",
       "  'with you anymore. they can act like theyre the first adult never to hear a swear word, and they can get really offended, right? so i went, are you fucking kidding me? and she went, please do not speak to me that way! i have done nothing wrong! and i said, are you, a white south african, telling me youve done nothing wrong? anyway tensions rose. the manager comes over. big fat cunt called simon fulcher, right? he walks over and goes, [in south african accent] what is wrong here? what is wrong? and i said, i bought a business class ticket and i want a business class ticket. and he goes, what do you want me to do? make a new chair for you? there are no more seats. i cant do anything. he goes, ill tell you what i can do. go up to the executive lounge. have some peanuts. enjoy a beverage. listen to rodriguez, and if something opens up, we will move you back up to business class. so i thought, theres nothing i can do. so i walk off with my ticket. im walking through the airport like, fucking british airways, bunch of fucking cunts. right? i get up to the counter. and the woman behind the counter said, tickets, please. and i hand over my ticket and she goes, [in south african accent] im sorry, sir, but this is for business class passengers only. your ticket says economy on it. and i said [inhales sharply] i bought a business class ticket, but you people have downgraded and as i was doing my little speech, she looked past me and went, next. [audience exclaiming] listen here, you fucking cunt. [audience laughing] all right? now, you say cunt in any foreign country, people lose their fucking shit. security came from everywhere. i was going, dont you fucking come near me, cunt! and i said, i want to speak to simon fulcher, like im and they go, all right. they ring the manager up, and then they go he goes, is it the pale australian man? and the guy went, yes. he goes, weve had problems with him. let him through. right? so i go through. im sitting there, im eating my peanuts. and im just angry now, going, fucking british airways. fucking cunts, fucking like that. and in walks in a group of americans, about  of them. you know the type, right? they all and whenever i see americans abroad ill do my impersonation of any american abroad. when americans are abroad, youre just pointing out shit you see. youre just walking around going, [in american accent] oh, this is great! look at that. thats a chair right there. okay. oh, whats that over there? okay. wonderful. great. right? and this group walked in, and one of the women in the group went like this, she went, [in american accent] did anyone else see that australian guy speaking to that lady out there? some people have no class. and i put my head around the pylon, and i went, you can fuck off and all! you dont know what ive been through! ive been downgraded! and as i said that,  other people who were given the same lie that i was given, that they were going to be the next people promoted up to business class, the penny dropped. none of us are getting promoted. they all lied to us, and we formed an angry militia in seconds. it was like a scene out of braveheart, and they all stood up and went, fucking downgraded! and the woman in the group was doing this, dont speak to me that way. who the hell do you think you are? and all the men in the group were like, hey, why dont you shut the fuck up? just shut the fuck up. ♪ it doesnt matter these people seem very angry, so ♪ and a guy breaks from the group and he tries to calm everyone down. and, sometimes, americans, sometimes, you can seem a little insincere. and he came up and he went, [in american accent] hey. hey. yeah, i get it. [exhales sharply] downgraded, yeah. that really grinds my gears, i tell you that. yeah, i would write a strongly-worded letter. i really would. and then i thought, at least this guys being nice, and i said, look, mate, dont worry about it. its not like its your fault. and i said, why are you in such a big group anyway? and he goes, oh, were in neil diamonds band. thats neil diamonds backup singer you just called a cunt there. and as he said that, neil diamond walked around the corner like a fucking superhero and i reacted like he was one. i went, neil diamond! and neil diamond went, [in husky voice] hey, whats going on? and then, for a second there, there was a bit of my brain that thought maybe neil diamond could solve problems. and i went, neil! me and all these people, weve been downgraded! and neil went, oh! oh, right. uh, well, maybe thats our fault. we decided to come back a day early. you can fuck off and all, neil diamond! and then a fight breaks out amongst the neil diamond band and the downgraded. punches are thrown. not by me. i dont know if you have the internet, but im not much of a fighter. im an excellent scurrier-awayer. i get down. hey, what have you got there? hiya! anyway, the airport police came. three people were arrested from the downgraded but three people were arrested from the neil diamond band, and that meant that three seats opened up in business class.

       " [\"armed with boyish charm and a sharp wit, the former snl writer john mulaney offers sly takes on marriage, his beef with babies and the time he met bill clinton all right, petunia. wish me luck out there. you will die on august , . thats pretty good. all right. hello. hello, chicago. nice to see you again. thank you. that was very nice. thank you. look, now, youre a wonderful crowd, but i need you to keep your energy up the entire show, okay? because no, no, no. thank you. some crowds some crowds, they have big energy in the beginning and then they run out of places to go. so i dont judge those crowds, by the way, okay? weve all gone too big too fast and then run out of room. weve all made a happy birthday sign wait. you get that poster board up, and youre like, i dont need to trace it. i know how big letters should be. to begin with, a big-ass h. followed by a big-ass a and oh, no! oh, god! okay, all right. real skinny p with a high hump, and then well put the second p below the hump of that first p, sort of like a motorcycle sidecar situation. and now i have no room for the y, so ill do a kind of curled-up noodle y. block letters and cursive look good together. and then you go to write birthday and you totally forget the lesson you just learned with happy. youre like, yeah, but the past is the past. big-ass b. surely more letters will fit in the same space. youre very friendly here in chicago. i mean, were all violent here, but youre very friendly. no, really. and i dont like confrontation, cause ive never been in a fight before. though, maybe you could tell that from the first moment i walked out on stage. i dont give off that vibe. some people give off a vibe of right away, theyre like, do not fuck with me. my vibe is more like, hey, you could pour soup in my lap and ill probably apologize to you. when i walk, for real, my feet go out like this. im so open and vulnerable. i look like a doll that you point out molestation on. show us on this white comedian where the man touched you. its been a while since ive been home to chicago. i got married since then. thank you. i married my wife. i love saying my wife. it sounds so adult. thats my wife. its great, you sound like a person. i said it even before we were married. we were just dating, and we were once getting on an airplane, and annas ticket didnt say anything and my ticket said priority access. it doesnt matter why. but we were getting on and i said, uh, can my wife board with me? and they were like, yes, of course. right this way. and i was like, oh, that is so much better than all those times i was like, can my girlfriend come?' and, yeah, i shouldnt have said it that way, but still. my wife just has some kick-ass to it, you know? get away from my wife! no one talk to my wife! marriage is gonna be very magical. i didnt kill my wife! thats like, ooh, whos that fella? i bet he did kill his wife. being married is so nice. i never knew relationships were supposed to make you feel better about yourself. thats not really a joke, thats just a little sweet thing i like to say. cause id been in relationships where i got cheated on, like, long ones. i dont know if youve ever been in a long relationship where you got cheated on, but it changes your whole worldview. cause when i was a kid, i used to watch americas most wanted. you know how kids do. and i would always think to myself, how could another person kill someone? how could a human being kill another human being? and then i got cheated on, and i was like, oh, okay. im not gonna do it, but i totally get it. and i dont mean in that way of, like, no one else can have you. i dont care about that. its just creepy to have an ex out there after things have ended badly. they have a lot of information. anyone whos seen my dick and met my parents needs to die. i cant have them roaming around. i talked to a lot of people before i got engaged, you know. and i heard this expression about whether or not you should get married. this is an old expression. people say this. they say, why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free? you ever heard that before? its a bananas insulting expression to an entire gender. but also, it makes no sense. why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free? youre not allowed to milk a cow that you dont own. thats not even a situation. was that a problem at one point? like, in the dairy community? was that happening a hundred years ago in some village? some dutch prick was sneaking in at night being like, ah-ha-ha, i take your milk. and the farmer was like, well, then, this is your cow now. and he was like, no, no proof of purchase. and he ran off into the night. that sounded dutch, right? you know what that you know what that expression means? it means, why would you marry a woman if she\",\n",
       "  's already having sex with you? which has nothing to do with what relationships are even like anymore. now, its like, why buy the cow? uh, maybe because, every day, the cow asks you when youre gonna buy it. and  you live in a really small apartment with the cow, so you cant avoid that question at all. and also, the cow is way better at arguing than you are. and the cow grew up in a family that knows how to argue. why buy the cow? uh, maybe because every time another cow gets bought, you have to go to the sale and you have to sit next to your cow at the sale, and your cow looks over at you the entire time like and does not enjoy the sale at all even though shes the one that wanted to go to the sale. and shes especially mad because that farmer and cow met, like, eight months after you guys met. why buy the cow? well, lets be real here. youre very lucky to have the cow that you do have. roping in cows and getting milk out of them was never anything you were known for, john. by the most liberal of estimates, there have been about eight cows total, several unmilked, and a lot of people think that you like bulls, and if you just bought they assume it. when you search your name, the third thing to come up is like, john mulaney bull? and if you just bought the cow, nobody would say that anymore. theyll still say it. cause there are those guys who, they buy a cow, and then on the side, total matador, but but, for real, chicago, why buy the cow? lets be real. why buy the cow? because you love her. you really do. and, yeah, yeah sure, shes a bossy little jew, but  she takes care of you. and you dont wanna be some old man stumbling around, like, hey, you seen any loose milk? my wife is jewish. shes a new york jew. i did it! now, i was raised catholic. i dont know if you can tell that from the everything about me. my wife is jewish, i grew up catholic, so we got married by a friend. being married by a friend is a beautiful ceremony that alienates both families religions, while confusing the elderly people at the wedding. whats the name of the bishop? thats actually stand-up comedian dan levy. he was the host of mtvs your face or mine? i saw a lot of catholic weddings, though, because i was an altar boy and a hush falls over the room. isnt it weird how that became a scandalous thing? that was just some boring shit i had to do on weekends. but now, its like saying, i was a french maid for a period of time. i was treated well in my day. i worked for a variety of sirs. no, being an altar boy was just a boring gig, you know? youd serve mass and then youd serve weddings sometimes. my brother was once an altar boy at a wedding, and he was standing there with another altar boy in this big, packed church in chicago where we grew up. and the bride was coming down the aisle, and the organ was playing, and all the pews were filled, and the bride got all the way to the altar, and the groom lifted the veil off of the bride, and right at that moment the other altar boy said, aw, shes ugly. and then they looked, and they were right next to the video camera. and i know thats awful, but wouldnt you give a million dollars to see that wedding video? it was the best moment of this stupid womans life, and shes walking down the aisle, and the organs like and she gets all the way to the altar to her betrothed, and he unveils her to the world and to the eyes of god. and right at that second, for no reason at all, some cheeto-fingered, rat-mustached, -year-old prick decides to go, aw, shes ugly! hopefully the videographer knew some sound editing so he could fix it to be like, aw, shes beautiful. shes enchanting. i grew up catholic. i dont go to church anymore. but i went on christmas eve with my parents, cause you know how you lie to your parents. so we go into the church and i was like, i got this under control. and then i got schooled because they introduced a bunch of new shit. no, i was going through mass and i was batting, like, .. and then in the middle of mass, the priest said, peace be with you. and everyone said, and with your spirit. and i was the one pre- asshole going, and also with you. what? huh? what? huh? what? when? when? for those of you that arent catholic, i dont mean to exclude you, even though we love to exclude you, but theres a part in church where the priest says, peace be with you. and for many, many years, we all said – and also with you. – very good. but they changed it to and with your spirit. because thats what needed revamping in the catholic church. that was the squeaky wheel that needed the grease. in rome, they were like, lets see. what problems can we solve? problem one. no. im actually glad they changed that, though. i never liked and also with you. i always found that clunky. and also with you. thats not how you ta',\n",

       "  'mom energy. and theyre always, so excited to see you two. we would have little conferences before we walked into a house. shed go, lets talk. lets talk before we go in. were, like, two feet from the door. so, theres no toilets. and i know that was on your list. but i think i can get him to budge. lets go. so, wed have a real estate agent, and then, like, the house would have a real estate agent whos just some guy sitting in a big chair. and these two always hated each other. theyd be like, hi, tony. hi, kim. its like, jesus christ! what, were you two in the eagles together? what is the animosity about? our real estate agent wanted us to have a baby more than anyone else in our lives, more than anyone in our family. she hinted about it constantly. every room she walked into, shed be like, so, this could be an office. or maybe a nursery. yeah. no, like we said, we dont know if were gonna have  no, no. i know, i know, you know. you dont know if youre gonna have em, but you know. you know, you never know. sometimes you dont know whats gonna happen, and then you know, something happens. well, yeah, thats how all of life works. okay, all right. okay. uh-huh. mmm. this is an on-fire garbage can. could be a nursery. she showed me a backyard once. she goes, i dont even like this backyard for you. i was like, oh, do tell. she said, its all pavement. i think you should have some grass out there. you know, in case you have a couple little guys running around in the grass. and i got offended on behalf of my imaginary kids. i was like, hey, lady. i went outside about as much as powder from the movie powder. my children are not gonna be playing out on grass. they will be up in their rooms playing violent video games and catfishing pedophiles. these are my children. and thats my wife! i didnt mean to make it sound like we dont want children. we dont, but i didnt mean to make it sound like that. see, i just dont think babies like me very much. sometimes babies will point at me, and i dont care for that shit at all. like, ill be on an elevator, and a baby will be there in its big, like, stroller activity tray, just, like, working on one cheerio with bobby fischer-like intensity. and itll look up at me and go i like to lean in and go, stop snitchin, motherfucker. and then walk off. cause youre never too young to learn our national no-snitching policy. my friends have babies and i dont do so well with them. i had a run-in with a two-year-old girl. i know there are better ways to start that story, but my friend, jeremy, has this two-year-old girl, and i really like her. shes a sweet kid. i really like his daughter a lot. but i was over at his familys house for the fourth of july, and he had his daughter on his knee. and it was a very lovely day. his whole extended family was there. and he was bouncing his two-year-old up and down, and he pointed at me and he said to his two-year-old, do you know who that is? thats your uncle john. and i was like, oh, my god. thats so sweet. im her uncle john. and then the baby pointed at me and said, uncle john has a penis. i thank you for laughing, because no one did that day! fell deadly silent, is what they all did. hey, do you know what youre supposed to say when a baby points at you and knowingly says, he has a penis? no, im asking, cause i dont know what to say in that situation. heres what i went with that day. i said, oh, come on! i dont know. i thought thatd be good. but then it just made it worse, cause it sounded like the baby and i had an arrangement not to talk about it, and she had violated my trust. like, the baby had been like, do you have a penis? and i was like, yes, i do, but youre a baby, so discretion is key. and then the next day she goes, he has a penis, and i go, oh, come on! someone cant keep a secret! luckily, jeremys wife saved the day. the babys mom saved the day. she came in and she picked up the baby, and she was like, its okay. shes just going through that phase where she says penis and vagina a lot. arent we all? and, by the way, it wouldve been a totally different situation if the baby had said vagina. like, if a grown woman had walked in the room, and the baby had been like, she has a vagina, the woman could be like, yes, i do, and its magnificent. and we would all be like, hooray! you are brave! no one wants to applaud the penis of a -year-old weirdo. its fun to be married. ive never been supervised before. im supervised. she studies what i do. like an anthropologist. shell be like, sometimes, he will watch a movie on tv even though he already owns that movie on dvd. pointing this out to him confuses and upsets him. i had no supervision when i was a kid. we were free to do what we wanted. but also, with that, no one cared about kids. i grew up before children were ',\n",
       "  'special. i did. very early , right before children became special. like, i remember when milk carton kids became a thing. when they were like, hey, we should start looking for some of these guys. i dont think theyre just blowing off steam. no one cared about my opinion when i was a little kid. no one cared what i thought. sometimes, people would say, what do you think youre doing? but that just meant stop. they didnt actually wanna know my thought process. they didnt want me to be like, well, i was gonna put this bottle rocket into this carton of eggs, so that when i lit off the bottle rocket, the eggs would explode everywhere. oh, well, thats very interesting. and what brought you to this experiment? oh, well, thank you for asking. well you know how im filled with rage? im so horny and angry all the time and i have no outlet for it. so eggs. your opinion doesnt matter in elementary school either. it matters in college. college is just your opinion. just you raising your hand and being like, i think emily dickinsons a lesbian. and theyre like, partial credit. and thats a whole thing. but in elementary school, it doesnt matter what you think, it just matters what you know. you have to have answers to questions. and if you say, i dont know, you get an x on your test, and you get it wrong and thats not fair, cause your brain has never been smaller. also, thats not how life works. im in my  now. if you came to me now and you were like, hey, john, name three things that the stamp act of  accomplished. id go, i dont know. get out of my apartment, you know? but when youre a little kid, you cant say, i dont know. you should be able to. that should be an acceptable answer on a test. you should be able to write in, i dont know. i know you told me. but i have had a very long day. i am very small. and i have no money. so you can imagine the kind of stress that i am under. or if its one of those true or false questions, you should be able to add a third option which is, whos to say? kids are much more supervised now, but also, they have a lot of rights. like, thats the biggest civil rights increase ive seen in my lifetime. the rights of children have gone through the roof. i had no rights when i was a little kid. i remember, one time, i walked into a supermarket by myself, and i walked in through the double doors, and the woman behind the register just looked at me and she went, no! and i went, all right. and i turned around and left. thats how broken i was. and there werent special things for kids the way there are now. like, we would just go see movies. any movie. like back to the future. that was a movie everyone could see. kids could kinda see it. great movie, right? i rewatched it recently. its a very weird movie. marty mcfly is a -year-old high school student whose best friend is a disgraced nuclear physicist. and, i shit you not, they never explain how they became friends. they never explain it. not even in a lazy way, like, hey, remember when we met in the science building? they dont even do that. and we were all fine with it. we were just like, what, whos his best friend? a disgraced nuclear physicist? all right, proceed. what a strange movie to sell to be a family movie. two guys had to go in and do that. they had to be like, okay we got an idea for the next big family-action-comedy. all right, its about a guy named marty, and hes very lazy. hes always sleeping late. okay. is he cool like ferris bueller? no. but he does have this best friend whos, you know, a disgraced nuclear physicist. im confused here. this best friend, this is another student? no, no, no. no, this guys either, like,  or . even we dont know how old this guys supposed to be. but one day, the boy and the scientist, they go back in time and they build a time machine. whoa! okay. i think i see where youre going here. they build a time machine, and they go back in time, and they stop the kennedy assassination. ah! oh, wow, thats a really good idea, i mean, we didnt even think of that. all right, well, what do they do with the time machine? well, now im embarrassed to say. ah, well, all right, all right, all right. we thought we thought it would be funny, you know, if the boy, if he went back in time and, you know, he tried to fuck his mom. i dont know. we thought thatd be fun for people. but, no, good point. no, he doesnt get to, he doesnt get to. cause this family friend named biff, he comes in and he tries to rape the mom in front of the son. the dads gotta beat the rapist off of her. and also, were gonna imply that a white man wrote johnny b. goode. so, were gonna take that away from em. well, this is the best movie idea i have ever heard in my life. were gonna make three of them. now, you say they go to the past. how about we call it back to the ',\n",
       "  \"past? no, no, no. back to the future. right, but they go to the past. yeah. kids have it very good now. my friends a teacher. she told me that, uh the parents will take the kids side over the teacher now. thats insane. that never happened. my parents trusted every grown-up more than they trusted me. i dont mean coaches and teachers. any human adults word was better than mine. any hobo or drifter could have taken me by the ear up to my front door and been like, excuse me! your kid bit my dick. and my mom would be like, john edmund mulaney, did you bite this nice mans dick? and i would be the only one whos like, hey, doesnt anyone wanna know why his dick was near my biters in the first place? isnt anyone curious as to how i had access? dont get me wrong, my parents love us. they just didnt like us. we werent friends. people are now like, my moms my best friend. i was like, oh, is she a super bad mom? my parents didnt trust us, and they shouldnt have trusted us. we were little goblins. we were terrible. i remember, one time, we were going to this resort for a vacation when we were little kids. three weeks before we went to the resort, my dad sat us down and he said, all right, were going to a resort, and ive just been informed that the man who owns the resort only has one arm. and we were like, oh, yes! yay! yes! now, im telling you three weeks in advance, so that you will not freak out when you see that he only has one arm. oh, were gonna freak out so bad! yes, john, you have a question? how did he lose his arm? thats exactly what you wont ask. and then i did ask. i went into the kitchen one day, and i was like, so, howd you lose your arm? and he was like, well, i was born with only one arm. and i was like, nah. no, my parents loved us. its just, like, they were the cops, you know? and we were criminals. so, we didnt get along. we only got along in that way that, like, cops will sometimes be chummy with criminals. like, when my dad and i would talk, it was like that scene in the movie heat, when robert de niro and al pacino sit down in that diner. we kind of had that rapport of, like, hmm, were not so different, you and i. you have your law practice, and me, i have all these fucking markers. i guess we both have responsibilities when you look at it that way. my dad would respect it if i could get away with breaking a rule. we had a rule in our house, you were not allowed to watch tv on a school night. so, every school night, i would % be watching tv. and i would hear my dad coming, i would immediately turn the tv off and grab any book, magazine, periodical, anything. and id open it and pretend to be doing homework. my dad would walk in the room and he would go, what are you doing? are you watching tv? and id go, no, man. im not watching tv. and the tv wouldnt even be dark yet. it would still have, like, a neon green halo around it. itd be sizzling like a glass of pepsi. and i would look my dad in the eyes and go, no, im just reading this yellow pages. my dad loved us. he just didnt care about our general happiness or self-esteem. i remember, one time, we were really little kids. i have two sisters and a brother, and all four of us were in our family car ride for three hours going to wisconsin. my dad was driving, going down the highway in our white van with wood around the side. cause you remember when you wanted your car to be made of wood? you remember that era? where we were like, how much wood can we get on this car without it catching on fire? but then the big announcement. we here at plymouth-chrysler can put a saucy stripe of wood safely on the outside of your car, for all those times youve looked at your minivan and thought, huh! it needs a belt.' so, were going on the highway. weve been on the road for three hours. and in the distance, we see a mcdonalds. we see the golden arches. and we got so excited. we started chanting, mcdonalds! mcdonalds! mcdonalds! mcdonalds! and my dad pulled into the drive-thru, and we started cheering. and then, he ordered one black coffee for himself. and kept driving. and, you know, as mad as that made me as a little kid, in retrospect, that is the funniest thing i have ever seen in my entire life. how perfect is that? he had a vanload of little kids, and he got black coffee. the one thing from mcdonalds no child could enjoy. my dad is cold-blooded. he once shushed a kid during lion king on broadway. that actually happened. we were at lion king on broadway, and there was a five-year-old behind us going, look, its pumbaa! look, its timon! and my dad turned around and said, are you going to talk the entire time? hes my hero. the weirdest thing when i was a kid was how much they scared us about smoking weed. they scared us about it constantly. and ive been on tour this year mari\",\n",
       "  'juana is legal in  or  states in some form or another. its insane. yeah, well all right, dont whoo if youre white. its always been legal for us. come on, sir. we dont go to jail for marijuana, you silly billy. when i was arrested with a one-hitter at a rusted root concert, i did not serve hard time. i think i got an award. eighteen or  states. and, by the way, i agree, its a very good thing. but its also a really weird thing, because this is the first time ive ever seen a law change because the government is just like, fine. you know? ive never seen it before. like, gay marriage and healthcare, we have to battle it out in the supreme court, and be like, gay people are humans. and theyre like, well think about it. but with weed, it was just something we wanted really badly, and we kept asking them for  years, like, excuse me. and then suddenly the government became like cool parents, and theyre just like, okay, here. take a little. wed rather you do it in the house than go somewhere else blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. those stupid parents. and thats a big deal because they scared us about weed constantly. it would be on our sitcoms. wed be watching saved by the bell, wed be having a great old time. and then, suddenly, a character we had not seen before would show up with some weed and the episode would stop cold in its tracks. and theyd always hold the joint the bad guy would hold the joint in a villainous way. theyd always offer the joint in a way that no one ever holds a joint. like its a skull in a shakespeare play. and now its legal, and that is great news. unless youre a weed dealer, and then it is terrible news. and i dont just mean because theyre about to lose out to amazon.com. i more feel bad for weed dealers cause theyre about to find out that we only showed them a certain amount of politeness because they had an illegal product. and we dont show that same politeness to people who deliver legal products. like, when the chinese food delivery guy comes, we dont let him hang out after hes delivered the chinese food. and we dont look the other way when he says weird shit to the girls were hanging out with to try to preserve the relationship. and we definitely dont give him some of the chinese food. hes never like, hey, can i get in on those dumplings? and were like, yeah, were all friends. what are you, on your phone? hey, v-neck. hey! – whats your name? – sam. sam? cool! what do you do to afford v-necks, sam? typing numbers. ah numbers, the letters of math. im sorry to bother you. i dont mean to single you out. i hate when people get pulled out of the audience. like, are you familiar with the cirque du soleil, sam? theyre a group of french assholes that are slowly taking over america by humiliating audience members one by one. we once went to see cirque du soleil at navy pier when i was a kid, and my brother came, and he was  years old. you remember being , when youre like, no one look at me or ill kill myself. and these french bastards come into the crowd, being like, le volunteer! and they pulled my brother up on stage, and i was like, no! and they brought him up, and they reached into his sweatshirt, and they were like and they had planted a bra, and they pulled out a bra and they were like and everyone at navy pier was like ah, ha, ha, ha, ha! and my brother was like, thats great! i have had other jobs besides comedy. i was an office temp for a while. i really miss that. i loved being a temp, because i would just go from office to office and be terrible at a different job for a week. and then you just get to retire like lou gehrig. youre like, thank you. no one will ever see me again. and theyre like, goodbye! i worked at an office once on  street in new york city. i was there for a couple weeks. i was in a cubicle next to this other cubicle. this woman named mischa sat in the other cubicle. i want to get the number right. i think mischa had about , photos of her daughter up in her cubicle. almost like she was trying to solve a conspiracy about her daughter, a beautiful mind-style. i think about mischa two times a week because of a phone call she had next to me one day. it was one of my first days, and i was sitting next to her. and her phone rang, and this was her call, and im quoting. her phone rang and she said, hello? hush! and then she hung up. think about that two times a week. and i didnt know her well enough by then to be like, hey, what kind of a person are you? you know? who could she have been talking to? hello? hush! this was a place of business. my only thought was that it was the ceo of the company being like, mischa, help. im doing a crossword puzzle. i need a four-letter word for be quiet right now. – hush! – youre promoted. i temped at a little web company on  street in new york city. i',\n",
       "  \"t was a small web company owned by this old man who was old, old, old money new york. his name was henry j. finch iv. like old, old, old money. like, his money was in molasses or something. he owned this web company. i have no idea why he owned this web company. i think he won it in a rich mans game of dice and small binoculars, or something. mr. finch wore linen suits. he had suspenders, he had a bow tie, he had a hat, he had a cane with an ivory handle. im giving you more description than you need, cause i need you to believe me. this was a real person i knew in the  century. mr. finch was in his . he had an assistant named mary. she was in her , she was korean. i dont know why he had an assistant. he did not need one. unless he needed someone to be like, remember, mr. finch, at five oclock, you need to keep looking like a hard-boiled egg. one day, mr. finch came into the office. it had been raining. everything im about to say to you was said in front of me on that afternoon. mr. finch walked into the office, and he was wearing a raincoat, he was wearing a rain hat, and he had his cane. and he walked in and he said, and im quoting, ah! one feels like a duck splashing around in all this wet! and when one feels like a duck, one is happy! and then mary yelled, ooh, ducklings! to which mr. finch replied, too old to be a duckling. quack, quack. and then walked into his office. i think about that every goddamn day. i mean, imagine youre me. youre a -year-old temp, and youre so hungover, and you just wanna die every day. and then that happens in front of you, and i dont know, gives you hope? and i did that a little fast. let me break that conversation down for you. mr. finch walked in, and he began a conversation the way anyone would. ah! one feels like a duck splashing around in all this wet! the rain. and when one feels like a duck, one is happy! now, thats debatable. but rather than debate that point, mary brought up a new, separate, but interesting point which was, ducklings! but mr. finch, ever the realist about his own age and mortality said, ah, too old to be a duckling! as if to say, my duckling days are behind me. mary, dont you see? im a duck now. and to prove it well, ill say just about the most famous catchphrase a duck has quack, quack.' and i knew right at that moment, by the way, that it meant nothing to mr. finch, what he had said. crazy people are like that. they have unlimited crazy currency. like, if i had gone into his office a couple weeks later and been like, hey, finch, you remember that time you were like, too old to be a duckling. quack, quack? he would just be like, ah, perhaps i did quack! but such is life for an old knickerbocker like me. like, hed say something else crazy. thats the wonderful thing about crazy people, you know? is that they just have unlimited currency. the things they say mean nothing to them, but they mean everything to me. i was once walking into penn station in new york. i was walking down  street towards eighth avenue. im walking down , theres this woman standing at eighth and . i have my little roller suitcase. you can all imagine. im walking towards her. shes smoking a cigarette that is not lit anymore. shes watching me walk, kind of scanning me up and down, as if she had terminator vision where she could see little bits of data, like, little honky ass, and could read information. as i walked past her, she said this to me. i walked past her and she said, and im quoting, eat ass, suck a dick and sell drugs. very dirty, yes? a very upsetting thing to hear, yes? im sorry you all had to hear that, but at least you all got to hear it as a group. i was alone out there that afternoon. and she said this totally unprompted. eat ass, suck a dick and sell drugs. it wasnt like i had paused in front of her and been like, what should i do with my life? so, i walk away from her with this to-do list. and i like structure, i like a to-do list. it did dawn on me that that list of things does get better as it goes along, when you really think about it. cause it starts in a pretty rough place. it starts with just about the worst task a to-do list can start with. but by the end, you have your own small business. and isnt that the american dream when alls said and done? that if you eat enough ass and suck enough dick, one day you can sell drugs. imagine you did all that to sell drugs and then they legalize drugs, and you were like, but i this has been a real thrill to perform here, by the way. i just wanna say that in all sincerity. thanks for coming to this. really, really appreciate it. i wanna tell you one more story before i get out of here, about the night i met a guy named bill clinton. now, i dont some of you know who that is? for those of you that dont, he was president of the u\",\n",
       "  'nited states from  until , and he is a smooth and fantastic hillbilly who should be declared emperor of the united states of america. now, i know you know who bill clinton is. but i was doing a show at a college, and i mentioned bill clinton, and, like, they kind of didnt know who he was. like, sorry, they knew the name, right? but they only knew this  bill clinton, whos a very different bill clinton. have you seen his ass lately? what the hell is he trying to pull? hes all thin now, and he wears these little tight suits, and hes got these grandpa reading glasses, like, hey, i cant do nothing to nobody no more. oh, me? im just an old, old man. i dont have the appetites. you know? and hes always flying around the world with bill gates trying to cure aids. that is not the bill clinton that we all signed up for  years ago. our bill clinton was like a big, fat buddy garrity from friday night lights-looking guy, who played the saxophone on arsenio, and his work in the std community was not in curing anything at that time. that was the man we all elected president. that was the bill clinton that i met. i got to meet bill clinton when he was governor clinton in , when he was first running for president. and i got to meet bill clinton because my parents had gone to the same college as bill clinton. theyre a little younger, but they went to the same college. so, when he was first running for president, he would have all these big, like, alumni fundraisers, and everyone who went was invited to go. now, this was really cool for a couple reasons. one, i got to meet bill clinton. but two, i got to watch my parents watch someone they went to school with become the president. and that is super funny to see, cause think about some of the people you went to school with. now imagine theyre becoming the president. imagine sam was becoming the president. it would stir up strong emotions. and my parents had very different opinions on bill clinton. my mom loved bill clinton, cause bill clinton was always a really charismatic, handsome guy. i mean, think about how many women he got in the  when he looked like frank caliendo doing john madden. now imagine him as a college student. and my mom tells me that there was this sort of chivalrous policy on campus back then, where, late at night, if female students were leaving the library unaccompanied, male students were encouraged to wait out in front and offer to walk them home. that sounds good, right? so, my mom tells me that bill clinton would be out in front of the library every single night just being like, hey, can i walk ya home? hey, can i walk ya home? hey, can i walk ya home? hey, can i walk ya home? and one night, my mom was leaving the library, and bill clinton was like, hey, can i walk ya home? and my mom was like, hell, yes. so this is absolutely true. my mom, little ellen stanton, walked arm-in-arm with bill clinton to her dorm. and she was like, you know, i wanted to invite him up for a beer. and i was like, thanks, im nine. but her roommate was upstairs, so she lost her chance with bill clinton. now, my dad, on the other hand, hated bill clinton, because my parents were dating during this time. and also, my dads a much more morally-upright, conservative kind of guy. he always told me that he hated it in college that bill clinton could, quote, get away with anything. can you imagine how he felt later? so, one day, this invitation arrives for a fundraiser where you could meet bill clinton. my mom opens it first and she goes, oh, we have to go. we have to go see bill. and without looking up at her, my dad just says, why? its not like hes gonna remember you. one black coffee. same motherfucker. so, my mom says, fine! ill go and ill take john. and i was like, hell, yeah. and i slid in the room in my first communion suit, ready to go. cause i loved bill clinton. i was ten years old. if you were a kid when bill clinton was first released, it was the most exciting thing ever. wed never seen a cool politician before. and he would go on mtv, and hed have cool answers to kids questions. theyd be like, governor, whats your favorite food? and hed be like, i dont know, fries? and wed be like, yay, we eat fries! i learned to play his campaign song on the piano. it was dont stop by fleetwood mac from rumours, an album written by and for people cheating on each other. he let us know who he was right away. so, i went with my mom, as her date to reconnect with governor bill clinton. we walked into the ballroom. it was a big hotel ballroom. it was the palmer house hilton, big hilton hotel ballroom. walked into the ballroom, it was packed with people. its actually the ballroom from the end of the movie the fugitive, remember? so, that ballroom. so, my mom and i walk in, its packed with people, ',\n",
       "  'the sorry, the end where harrison ford, as dr. richard kimble, bursts in to confront dr. charles nichols, right? okay. so, that ballroom. so, my mom and i walk in, its packed with people. why does kimble confront nichols? well, i know we all know this, but no, no. but, but, but kimble, he found out that nichols, along with devlin macgregor and lentz, who has mysteriously died, they had hired frederick sykes, the one-armed man, to kill kimble. kimbles wife wasnt even the target. i know we all know this. but they were gonna kill kimble because he wasnt gonna approve certain liver samples to pass rud-. so, kimble finds out about all of this, and, of course, hes furious. and he bursts into the ballroom and he goes, you switched the samples! and dr. nichols is like, ladies and gentlemen, my friend, dr. richard kimble. what accent did that guy have, by the way? he goes, you switched the samples! and you doctored your research! so that you could have provasic! anyway, so its that ballroom. so, we walk into that ballroom. it was packed with people. it was packed with people. a real whos not of chicago celebrities. walter jacobson was there. walter jacobson was the local fox anchor. hed do fun things where hed go undercover as a homeless person. and hed be like, oh, what time is the soup? and theyd be like, man, youre walter jacobson. he was there. everybody. and on the far side of the ballroom, under a spotlight, we saw a little bit of silver hair. and it was him bill clinton. the comeback kid. but he was surrounded by reporters, and photographers, and secret service. so, what are you gonna do? well, if youre my mom, you ball up the back of my sport coat, and you push me forward like a human shield. and then you start jogging while yelling, this ten-year-old boy has to meet the next president of the united states! kind of implying that i might be dying. my feet were not on the ground. she was swinging me like a snowplow. i was just mowing down fat chicago democrats. i pushed past all the reporters, i pushed past all the photographers. we pushed past all the secret service. we land at bill clintons feet. bill clinton turns, looks at my mom and says, hey, ellen, cause he never forgets a bitch, ever. my mom melts. she goes, hi, bill. then it is revealed that she has no plan. so she pushes me towards clinton and she goes, this is my son, john, and hes also going to be president. and i was like, what the hell are you talking about? im not gonna be president. and i know now that im definitely never gonna be president. not unless everyone gets real cool about a bunch of stuff really quickly. based on my ten-year-old memory, bill clinton is about  feet tall. and he leaned down, because, well, i was wearing this button that i bought outside the fundraiser. it was a cartoon button of george h. w. bush, and it had a quail flying over his head, and it was shitting on his head. and it said, bird-brained. and i thought it was very funny. and bill clinton leaned down so that only i could hear and he said, hey, man, i like your button. and i said, you can do whatever you want forever. and he took my advice. and it was the best night of my entire life. and i got home that night i got home that night, and my dad was still awake, like, reading angry under one lamp, just like and i went up to him and i went, hey! im gonna be a democrat. and im gonna vote for bill clinton. and without looking up at me, my dad just said, you have the moral backbone of a chocolate éclair. you know, how you talk to a child. so, heres the end of that story. that was . lets flash forward five years to . it is now . i am a sophomore in high school, bill clinton is in his second term as president. and on the morning that the monica lewinsky scandal breaks on the cover of the new york times. it had been on the drudge report, and then it was on the cover of the new york times. that morning, i wake up to the newspaper hitting me in the face. i am a teenager asleep in bed, and the newspaper hits me in the face and falls open on my stomach. and i open my eyes to see my dad standing there dressed for work, and he says, the other shoe just dropped. and then my dad went in to work to find out that his law firm had been hired to defend bill clinton. good night, chicago. your email address will not be published. required fields are marked * name* e-mail* website  \\n\\n stand-up special by jim gaffigan. louis c.k. being louis c.k. without restraint. comedian drew michael is taking the stage and is holding nothing back in his first hbo stand-up special, in which he navigates his fears, anxieties and insecurities in an unconventional stand-up setting. follows drew michael and his issues with relationships, social media, and comedy as therapy. ©  scraps from the loft. all rights r'],\n",

       "  't doesnt matter if you believe me. it really doesnt matter. the important thing is that i would pass a lie detector test. i like to test myself. i like to test myself by joking about horrible things and nothing but. one of my favorite ways to test myself, i like to joke about tragedies the day that they happen. the day they happen. i dont believe in too soon. im on a tight schedule. and im good at it. im good at it. like, the day of the day of the aurora, colorado batman movie theater shooting. the day it happened, i went online, i went on twitter, and i tweeted other than that, how was the movie? right? right? nailed it. nailed it. and the reason i get away with that the reason i get away with stuff like that is im just the guy who does it. people are used to it from me. it would be weird if i didnt make a joke the day of a tragedy. which is why i was very surprised when i got in a lot of trouble the day of the boston marathon. now, i dont follow the news regularly. but i know the second a tragedy happens because i get  text messages saying, dont do it. and whenever i see that whenever i see that, it makes me sad. it makes me sad cause i know something horrible has happened. people will say, anthony, whats funny about aurora? whats funny about the boston marathon? whats funny about your grandmothers funeral? nothing! nothing is funny about those things. thats where i come in. so i see these texts and im like, oh, no, what happened? but i also think, ive got a job to do. so i go online, i start reading about it. i dont want to watch the footage. but ill read about what happened. and i think, how can i make someone laugh today? and then i think, i got it. i go back on twitter. and i tweet, guys, today, there are just some lines that should not be crossed. especially the finish line. and again, i think, nailed it. u.s.a.! u.s.a.! but then my phone starts to ring. and its my boss. or should i say my former boss. and they say, anthony, this is unacceptable. you are not just a comedian today. youre also the host of your own tv show, with your name in the title, on our network. you take this joke down right now or youre fired. and i say, go fuck yourselves. and i meant it. i didnt get into comedy for money or fame. i know that sounds wrong, because im dripping with both. i only got into this business so that no one could tell me what to do. and they said sure. they said, well, anthony, you dont understand. you dont understand at all. if you dont take this joke down right now, if you dont delete this joke right now, not only are you fired, but the entire cast and crew of your television show, about a hundred people, theyre also out of a job. and im ashamed to tell you this. im embarrassed to admit it. but in that moment, i folded, and i deleted the joke. cause im happy to fight for what i believe in. im happy to take the consequences for what ive done. but what i could not do, cannot do, is walk up to my cameraman and say, hey, buddy, no work for you on monday. i had this sweet tweet. couldnt do it. but as soon as i hit delete, i got mad and i regretted it. i would fire every single one of those fucking assholes now, ill tell ya that. and i got mad for betraying myself and everything i believe in. im just as mad today as i was then. just as mad. so mad, i had to have a meeting with the network, where they called me in for a little lecture. theyre like, anthony, were family. why are you so ups',\n",
       "  'et? cant you see we did you a favor? dont you worry about your career? let me ask you, san francisco, do i seem like i worry about my career? no. you know why people who win the lottery always end up going bankrupt? because if theyre worried about their money, they wouldnt have played the lottery in the first fuckin place. i do not worry about my career. and they said, anthony, the problem is when you make a joke on twitter the day of a tragedy, it seems like youre making fun of the victims, and thats wrong. but thats not what im doing. because, you see, the day of a tragedy, victims are not on twitter. am i wrong? tell me im wrong. the day of a tragedy, victims have got victim shit to do. no one is ever no one is ever putting on a tourniquet, asking, hey, are we trending? no. this is who im making fun of when i make a joke on twitter the day of a tragedy. the people who see something horrible happen in the world and they run to the internet. and they run to their social media, facebook, twitter, whatever they got. and they all write down the exact same thing: my thoughts and prayers my thoughts and prayers with the people in aurora. my thoughts and prayers with the families in boston. do you know what thats worth? fucking nothing. fucking less than nothing. less than nothing. you are not giving any of your time, your money or even your compassion. all you are doing, all you are doing, is saying, dont forget about me today. dont forget about me. lots of crazy distractions in the news, but dont forget how sad i am. those people are worthless and they deserve to be made fun of. theyre like a wedding photographer who only takes selfies. you understand? now im sure everyone here has told a joke before where nobody laughed at it. its fine. its embarrassing, but its fun. you can laugh at yourself. its not a reason to stop telling jokes. maybe some of you have told a joke before where someone got mad at you for it. trust me, thats fun too. you guys ever tell a joke and then get death threats? well, i guess thats what makes me me. on my television show, i once did a segment that aired once and only once, before it was banned, called shark party. all right? now some of you enjoyed it, but if youve never seen shark party, you can never see shark party. its been wiped off the face of the earth by the powers that be, so i will explain it to you. i love sharks. i love sharks more than anything. people people i can barely fucking tolerate. every single year,  million sharks are killed by human beings. every year, ,  people killed by sharks? so when i hear about a shark attack, im like, fuck, yeah. win one for the home team. so as soon as i get this show where i can do what i want, i say, you know what? i want to have a shark party. as soon as theres a shark attack, were having a shark party. and i get lucky. about a month into my run, this guy from new zealand gets eaten by a great white, the champagne of sharks. and i know exactly what to do. ive already got the script written. i walk on stage, in front of the cameras. i say, ladies and gentlemen, this guy from new zealand has been eaten by a great white shark. its time for a shark party. lights go down, music comes up. six women wearing shark dresses come out on either side of me, and we all start dancing. for way too long. a stripper wearing a giant shark head runs out and gives me a lap dance. very tasteful. and then i stand up and we show a gia',\n",
       "  \"nt picture of the guy who got eaten. which, in retrospect, is where it all went wrong. but i get to say my favorite thing ive ever said on television: smile, you son of a bitch. shark party. and in america, where im famous for those types of shenanigans everybody was like, anthony, that was fucked up. it was fucked up to see you dance. end of controversy. however, in new zealand, where they dont get my show, theyve never seen me, and frankly, they dont get out much the new zealand media takes the video and they show it to the guys family. and they say, what do you guys think about this? and they say, crikey, or whatever the fuck they say over there. the point is, all of new zealand, all of new zealand rises up against me. all  of those cunts rise up. and start threatening my life. now, i dont read the things that people write about me on the internet. but i pay people who do. and they come to me, and theyre like, weve got some terrible news. please sit down. they say, you are getting a lot of death threats online from new zealand because of shark party.' and i was like, really? new zealand wants to kill me? thats weird because they didnt even kill the shark. i said, how many death threats am i getting? and they were like oh, all of them. you are getting all of the death threats. what do you want us to do? we can send someone to talk to them. extra security? what do you want? i said, no, forget about it. leave it alone, dont worry. this might be hard for some to understand. ive said it several times tonight. everyone is going to die. i know full well i am going to die. and most of us dont get to choose how we check out. but if i die because someone murders me over one of my jokes? best case scenario. if somebody murders me over one of my jokes, i immediately become a legend. im a comedy god. the mount rushmore of comedy is me, four times. i said, come on then. my security guys are like, okay, anthony, well, just so you know, that is the dumbest thing weve ever heard. but youre the boss. okay. and they leave. and then the next day they come back. and they say anthony, sorry to bother you again. i know you didnt care yesterday, but its gotten much worse. youre gonna wanna hear this. they say, someone from new zealand tracked down your mom and dads phone number and address in pittsburgh, posted that online and now your entire family is getting death threats from new zealand. and i have to admit, that had never occurred to me before. it never crossed my mind that my family, my loved ones, would ever pay the price, be caught in harms way, for something ive done or ive joked about. and honestly, i would cut my throat for my jokes. i would give my life for what i do. but if anyone, and i mean this for a fact, if anyone ever hurt my family or killed someone i cared about because of a joke ive made? even better. this man is fantastic\\ni watched the show  times  and i laughed so much everytime your email address will not be published. required fields are marked * name* e-mail* website  \\n\\n stand-up special by jim gaffigan. louis c.k. being louis c.k. without restraint. comedian drew michael is taking the stage and is holding nothing back in his first hbo stand-up special, in which he navigates his fears, anxieties and insecurities in an unconventional stand-up setting. follows drew michael and his issues with relationships, social media, and comedy as therapy. ©  scraps from the loft. all rights re\"],\n",
       " ['wow. hey, thank you. thanks. thank you, guys. hey, seattle. nice to see you. look at this. look at us. were here. this is crazy. its insane. so about five years ago, pretty much everyone who i know started to get married, and that was strange for me because i dont really believe in the idea of marriage. and that would have been fine, except i have a problem where sometimes when i think that i am right about something, it can be a real source of tension between me and the person im arguing with. and the reason its a source of tension is that im right. and so i remember distinctly talking to my friend dana, and she goes, well, you dont believe in marriage for you, but, of course, you believe in it for other people. and i was like, no, i think its insane, you know, for anyone. and she said, why?\\nand i said, well, first of all, it just seems doomed. you know, % of marriages end in divorce. thats just first marriages, by the way. second marriages, % to % end in divorce. third marriages, % to % end in divorce. thats a learning curve.\\nsecond of all, monogamys impossible, or at the very least, not a sure thing. when i say that, i think people assume that im implying that men are incapable of being faithful. i think women are just as incapable, but for more sophisticated reasons, you know. i mean, with men, were just really simple. we have a very simple sexuality. when i say that, my female friends are like, well, we like sex just as much as you do. and i said, sure, but its different. and they say, how? and i say, have you ever masturbated while driving a car?\\nnumber three im never gonna be happy. why would anyone want to be a part of that? i think thats not brought up often enough. i, um, i didnt know that would be the reaction. oh, no, thats the hopeful part. the, uh i had one ally in all this, which is my friend andy, and hes a comedian as well. not only did we decide we werent gonna get married, we actually tried to stop other people we knew from getting married. yeah, we were pretty good at it. like, we stopped or put on hold three or four marriages, you know. we were we were pretty good. i mean, we werent like the best in the world. im sure there are better in europe. but we were we were solid, you know. like, so, like, for example, at point my friend alex was about to get engaged. and so we just took him to dinner. and during dessert, we gave him a long, hard stare. we said, are you sure this is what you want to do? and then we went cold to give him the sense of what it would feel like when we werent friends anymore. so february , , im at andys house in los angeles. and earlier in the night, i got in an argument with my girlfriend on the phone, and it was a bad one because i knew that i was right. and andy was a perfect person to be with in this kind of a situation cause hes the kind of friend who just takes your side regardless of whether youre right. he says stuff like, she sounds crazy. like, even if what shes saying isnt that crazy, like, youd be like, she only eats whole wheat bagels. hed be like, she sounds crazy! youd be like, thats not even the crazy part! you know. so im telling him about his argument. and he goes, youre right. i go, i know. im right. he goes, yeah, youre right. i go, i know im right. i got to tell her about this in the morning. and i get in my rental car to head back to my hotel, and im driving out of andys small road, and im t-boned! i dont know if youre familiar with this term, uh this is the culinary way of describing when you are hit by another car drivers side at a -degree angle, like a t-bone steak. and in  / seconds, im spun around, and i think im dead. no, wait, im paralyzed. and then i hear nothing. and then i hear the other car skid out and drive away. i know. let me tell you how this argument started. i met jenny in st. louis. my friend andy and i were working for her company. they were performing for a bunch of wrestling coaches, which is really my demographic. i, uh no, i was very nervous about this. i was actually kind of about to go onstage, and i was, like, scrawling notes on my napkin. a lot of times ill write kind of manic notes on napkins or hotel stationary. and jenny looked at me, and she goes, what are you doing? and i said, im writing my set list. and then she goes, i think itll be fine. and i was like, no, it wont be fine. and then she was like, i think it will be okay. and i said, why do you think that? and she said, well, you look so nervous, i think theyll feel sorry for you. but jenny has this really soft, sweet voice, like the kind of voice where you kind of get away with saying anything. at one point, she said, it seems like you comedians are a lot funnier onstage. normally, id be offended by that, but in this instance, i was like, you are right. that is a great point. you are beautiful, you know. she re she really was. you know, from the moment i met jenny, i knew i wanted to sleep with her at least once. stay with me. uh, i mean i mean that in, like, in the most meaningful way. like, that was the most that i was capable of in my life at that point. i id jus id just come off a really long, difficult breakup with my college sweetheart where we were gonna get married, and and then we werent. and then when we werent, i was so heartbroken, i just kind of swore off the idea of marriage or even living with someone entirely, you know, and but from the moment i met jenny, i just wanted to be with her. and i didnt i didnt think it was gonna happen. like, i dont have that kind of confidence. i actually think of myself as a sex maybe, which is to say that if im seeing a girl, shed think, id have sex with him, maybe. you know, and im im not ashamed of that. there were periods in my life where i was a sex never. or a sex with self always. yeah',\n",
       "  '. and often. surprisingly often. yeah, i just dont give off a great first impression. like, ill give you an example. like, this is the shirt i decided to wear tonight. like, i didnt i didnt spill mustard on the real shirt and this is the backup shirt. i mean, this is my a outfit. my b outfit was naked. i like to dress down to perpetuate the myth that i might be a fixer-upper. ive reached this point in my life i dont really look in the mirror before i leave my apartment. i glance at it to make sure im not bleeding. you know what i mean? like but i dont stare at the mirror. if i stare at the mirror, i get angry. like, i feel like im complaining about a bad call a ref just made. im like, come on! youre blind if youre leaving the house like that! and the ref is god, and the competing teams are my gut and my receding hairline. and its a close game cause my gut is large and my hairline is fast, and im all riled up. im about to charge the field. and the guy comes by with fried dough. and im like, next time. you know, thats how i go for fried dough, cause i have a problem. i just this is ridiculous. can you follow me over here for a second? im gonna jump off stage. this is only in seattle where someone is wearing no shoes? no shoes or socks? what? who are you people? what is wrong with you? i would expect that behavior from this guy, but not you, sir, not you! what is this? where do you think you are? from seattle! yeah, seattle. so ive been going, uh, recently to a womens exercise class. i-ive given up on having a traditional male physique. and so now im going for strong, independent woman. and, uh its going pretty well, you know. im not as good in the class as you might think. sometimes ill kind of skip whole sections of the more difficult exercises when the instructor isnt looking. but then when she looks over, i always have to strike a pose as though ive been doing what everybody else has been doing. it reminds me of the olympics. you know how they do gymnastics, how theyll have those the girls will do those crazy flips and twirls. and every once in a while and im not saying i root for this to happen, but sometimes theyll fall, and its ugly cause theyre rolling around like, im in a lot of trouble. like, i dont even know how i got here. but at the end of that, no matter what and i totally fall for it. im like, that cant possibly be the same loser from moments ago. i mean, thats a completely different person. this person has much better posture, for starters. i really wanted jenny to come out with me and andy that night in st. louis cause we were going out to one of these famous irish pubs where no one can hear anyone speak. and so i thought that might work to my advantage. i dont know, and, uh i didnt have the nerve to ask her myself, and so i convinced andy to ask her for us. and, uh pfft. which yeah, i dont know if that was the best idea cause, uh, were heading were in the car heading to the pub, and jenny says, oh, i left my i.d. at the hotel. and i was like, oh, we can just swing back and get it. and shes like shes like, no, itll be fine. i was like, no, it wont be fine cause its st. patricks day, and theres bouncers. and she goes, no, itll be okay. and i was like, no, it wont be okay. and then we get to the pub, and it was fine. like, the bouncer just kind of waved her through, which has not been my experience with bouncers. for me, bouncers are like prison guards. and for jenny, theyre like birthday clowns like, you know, what can i do to make your day better?\\nyou know, and thats were at the pub, and it had taken so much convincing for andy to get jenny to come out there. by the time she came out, she thought she was on a date with him. and, yeah, that wasnt the idea. and so i said i had to convince him to fall away as the night went on, like the red rockets on the space shuttle. and eventually, she realized she was on a date with me, and she was not happy about that. but, uh but she warmed to me as the night went on cause she was drinking, and then, like no, by the end of the night, we were laughing and having a good time, and we i caught a break, which is we shared a ride back to our hotel with one of their friends, and she and i were stuffed in this little back seat together. and it was really quiet, so i could hear her soft voice. and she told me she had just come off a long, difficult breakup, and i told her about my breakup. and for a moment there in the back seat, it felt like we were holding up two halves of a broken paper heart, and we get back to the hotel, and i offer to walk her to her room, and she says, sure. we get to her door, and i didnt want this night to end. and so i build up the courage to lean in to kiss her, and she says, oh, no, thank you. which i thought was polite but disappointing. i mean, theres something about a rejected kiss that is the most personal type of rejection because youre really putting yourself out there. youre just like, i think we should connect mouths, you know, and the other persons like, i do not think we should connect mouths. and those are theyre two very different mouth agendas, you know. and then you just feel so stupid. youre like, i never should have suggested we connect mouths, you know. this is a sore subject for me. i have sort of a long history of failed kisses. like, i i remember growing up, like, when people started making out. like, in my time in massachusetts, it was in seventh grade. i remember i remember it like it was yesterday cause i was shocked. i was like, people we know are just making out with other people we know? but how? you know. it seemed like an alien ritual where these two aliens just attach orifices all of a sudden. i was like, i am not doing that. and collectively, all the girls in my class were like, that is',\n",
       "  ' fine. you are not on the list. youre not exactly a first-round draft pick for our new activity. i was like, perfect. it seemed so gross to me. and it still does kind of. like, sometimes you hear these homophobic arguments from these guys who are like, i dont like when i see two dudes making out in the street. and i feel that way about anyone. like, making out is just sloppy. its like watching a dog eat spaghetti. thats how i make out. is that right? does anybody know if thats right? okay, good. so in seventh grade, i was like, im not gonna make out with anybody. and that was fine for a while, but increasingly, it kind of divided the class into two distinct parts. it was like, the make-out club and the non-make-out club. and these were informal organizations, of course. i mean, i would be sad if that were school-sanctioned, like, we call this meeting of the non-make-out club to order. first order of business, nintendo. second order of business, why doesnt anyone like us? meeting adjourned. i dont know, it was a sad group, and we were losing good guys by the day. i feared i feared that soon i would be the lone member of the non-make-out club, so i was like, i got to try to get into the make-out club. but it was a very intangible goal. i didnt really talk to a lot of girls, and there was one girl who sat in front of me in class named lisa bazetti who i had a huge crush on, but she was way out of my league. like, she had many suitors. she had i dont the rest of the show is in old english. uh she doth had many suitors! uh, no, she had many, you know, admirers. and there were three of us, really, and i was in third place in all the trade publications, but i had one advantage over these other guys, which is she had to talk to me on the phone every night about homework, thanks to alphabetical order. bazetti, birbiglia. one time i said something on the phone that made her laugh, and i was like, oh, this is great. i got to do that more. and one time we were on the phone, and she was laughing so hard, i remember so well cause she goes, mike, you got to stop. im gonna pee myself. and i was like, wow. this was the closest id ever come to a vagina. so spent the next  years trying to get lisa bazetti to pee. and thats how i ended up here. yeah. thats how we all ended up here, in a sense. so uh so heres what happened with lisa. one time i built up the courage to ask her to go to the carnival with me, and she said yes. i couldnt believe it. like, all of a sudden i thought, well, maybe this will be like one of those romantic comedy montages. well go to the carnival, well get stuck on the top of the ferris wheel, well make out. itll all take a minute and a half, and it will be set to phil collins song. but i think that when youre  years old, you just dont understand certain things about your digestive system. you dont know that you shouldnt eat popcorn and peanuts and ice cream and cotton candy and then step onto a machine called the scrambler. cotton candy being the most insane of these items. its basically saying, were gonna take sugar, which everyone knows is bad, but then well dress it up like insulation. and im like, im not sure what the selling point is there. is it the sugar or the insulation? theyre like, we already sold it. im like, well done, way to move the product before the information campaign disseminates. i dont know if you have the scrambler here in seattle. i imagine you might. it travels on a truck. it is a very mobile scrambling unit. the premise is very simple. you just sit on a two-person pod with the person you are in love with, and that pod goes in a circle, which is part of a larger circle, which is part of an even grander circle. as i understand it, it was originally designed as a medical device for constipated patients. it was called the shits of pants-erator, and it was wildly successful. and then it was co-opted by the carnival workers of america. cwoa. and they said they said, we like it, but we do feel like the name is a little bit of a turnoff. and then one guy says, well, what about the i think im gonna die-erator? and theyre like, thats good, cause it gets across the essence of how you feel when youre on the machine. plus it has the added wordplay with diarrhea, which is a nice homage to the original intention of the machine, but we still feel like the name might be a little bit of a turnoff. and then one guy goes, well, what about the scrambler? cause it scrambles you! theyre like, we get it, frank, but who frank is a maniac. this guy cant be stopped, but every once in a while, hes got a good idea. but who will be in charge of this dangerous piece of equipment? and this one guy goes, well, i have a nephew whos  years old and smokes pot  hours a day. i feel like he might be available. and theyre like, he sounds amazing. we dont even need to interview him. he sounds completely qualified.\\ni sit down with lisa on the scrambler, and im feeling good. like, shes snuggling up close to me, and im thinking im thinking like, this could be it. this could be where its all gonna happen. this is very special. and then they put that bar seat belt down. and the bar seat belt is not a reassuring piece of safety equipment. its not a ralph nader approved item. i dont think its saved lives. i think the only thing its ever done is in a scrambler accident, its just sort of held someones esophagus down to the pavement, making sure that they are dead and that they cannot talk about the scrambler accident. first rule of scrambler accident, dont talk about scrambler accident. thats from scrambler club. well, i knew from the moment they put the bar seat belt down that i was going to throw up for sure. and i even said to the -year-old stoner, i was like, hey, actually and then he was gone. apparent',\n",
       "  'ly, he doesnt enjoy the second halves of sentences.\\nso then im scrambling, and as i am scrambling, im thinking, i need to come up with a plan of some kind. im not going down without a fight. my first plan was very simple. it was just dont look at lisa, dont look at any other people. i was like, dont look at lisa, dont look at any other people. dont look at lisa, dont look at any other people. i need a new plan. and the new plan was i needed to tell the scrambler operator that he needed to stop the ride, but the mathematics of the scrambler are such that the window of opportunity in which one can communicate with the scrambler operator is a very limited window. so im like, i got to tell him hes got to stop the ride. i got to tell him hes got to stop the ride. i got to tell him hes got to stop the ride. please stop the ride! and im back! im not sure he heard me. i got to say it louder. please stop the ride! im not sure hes paying attention. i think he might be smoking pot right now. the third time i said, please stop. and then i started throwing up, and it was not unlike an oscillating lawn sprinkler, just popcorn, peanuts insulation. really, insulating the pavement with my homemade carnival salsa. i did not look at lisa. but im pretty sure she was staring at me because i was a spectacle at that point. i was spectacular. and we did not make out. i did not lose my mouth virginity that evening. two years later, it gets worse. um im at the st. johns high school, what they call a cattle call dance. this is an all boys catholic school i attended where they would invite the girls from all over the state to our sweaty st. johns gymnasium like cattle, which is a friendly way to describe women, you know. so cattle shows up at :. well make out with the cattle. cattle goes home at :. then we go out for burgers. completely separate from the cattle analogy. it was a horrible affair. it was just like this room chock-full of sweat and hormones and drakkar noir and led zeppelin and making out. at this point, i was, indeed, the lone member of the non-make-out club, but it was actually worse than that cause i had to lie to my friends and tell them i had had my first kiss cause it was, like, this really tough, all boys school. and so when they would ask, like, oh, have you had your first kiss? id be like, yeah, like, all the time. like, every every week. i always feared at some point thered be a follow-up question like, oh, yeah? whats it like? and id be like, yeah, you know, its just like licking an ice cream cone. and theyd be like, no, its not. its like sucking on a rocket pop. and id be like, ah, wrong frozen dessert analogy. im at the dance, and im flanked by my friend sam ricciardi. and were introduced by our friend tom to these girls from his town. they were the last two cows at the dance. they were like, moo! and we were like, moo! and then sam says one of these phrases i think weve all heard but is very uncomfortable to repeat. he says, you get that one. which i know its the worst turn of phrase, but im comfortable saying it cause i know ive been on the negative end of that conversation where a girl says of me, you get that one. and then her friend goes like, oof. you know, or even worse or even worse, like, you owe me, which really hurts thinking of someone incurring debt based on my appearance. i would hate to hurt someones credit score, you know. so he goes he goes, you get that one. and then im just fast dancing with this girl, sandra, to young mcs bust a move. and im not great at fast dancing, but they had the strobe light going, so its only catching me one out of every five hey! so shes losing interest, but at / the speed. and then im saved by a slow song, stairway to heaven, which is a classic make-out anthem. led zeppelin, eight minutes long. whats great about slow dancing is you cant really mess it up cause its just sort of a slow-motion hug. like, the only way you could mess it up is if you just started fast dancing in the middle of it. shed be like, what are you doing? and id be like, i dont pick up on social cues, you know. but its such a long song, you know, stairway, so im just trying not to fidget. im sort of a fidgety person. i feared if i fidgeted too much, i might initiate the head tilt too early. i didnt know anything about making out, but id seen people do it. i could see theres, like, a head tilt. i had heard there were tongues involved. and i could see that there was, like, some kind of space in between the two mouths. to me that was the most mysterious part of the whole thing. what is happening in that space? there is no you know, theres no video documentation of that area. its like the giant squid of making out. no one has seen it alive. theyve only seen it washed up on the shore which is more specific to the squid side of that analogy, but so im trying not to fidget. then with  / minutes left in stairway to heaven, the song hits that crescendo all around me, kids start to make the tilt. just a harvest of teenagers making out all around me. and i was like, oh, no. i dont want to be alone anymore. and i make the slightest tilt. and then sandra comes in strong, and then its an all-out mouth war. and she had artillery cause she had braces. it was like a dog eating spaghetti and the fork. as this oral atrocity is taking place, all i can think is, im not alone anymore! im not in the non-make-out club! and all i wanted to do was tell my friends, but i couldnt because up until that point, id lied and said that id had my first kiss. i walked off the dance floor, sam was like, howd it go, dude? i had to be like, same as always. pretty smooth. as the week wore on, i started to convince myself, well, maybe it did go well, and i should call sandra, and this could bud into a relationship',\n",
       "  ' of some kind, but i got her number from tom, and those conversations ended up being very brief, you know. we didnt have a lot to talk about. i remember just being like, hey, you like full house? me neither. cool. all right. later. you know what i mean? at certain points, i remember getting this vibe from her, kind of like, why are you calling me? and i remember thinking, oh, im probably reading into that one too much, and and then she stopped calling me back. and i was like, oh, yeah, i read into that one perfectly. but i just felt so dumb about the whole thing, and the worst part is i couldnt even tell my friends, until one day i was i was standing by my locker with my friend tom, and so i said to him, i was like, hey, whats going on with sandra? like, she hasnt called me back. and tom has this knowing grin on his face. i was like, what? tom was like, nothing. and i was like, what? tom was like, nothing. and i was like, what? toms like, oh. i talked to sandra, and she said youre the worst kisser shes ever kissed. and it was so devastating cause not only was it probably true, but i couldnt explain to my friends why it was true. i couldnt say, that makes sense. ive never done that before. so instead i had to play it off. i had to be like, yeah, that sounds about right. im a terrible kisser. thats kind of my thing. so i lean in to kiss jenny, and she says, oh, no, thank you. she agrees to go out with me in new york. we were both living in new york, and she gave me her number, and i typed it in my phone, and from that point on, she would be jen, irish pub, nice. a few weeks later, i took her out to a restaurant i couldnt afford to show her how much money i could put on my credit card. were out to dinner, and she says to me, she goes, everyone hates me at work, and i said, why would they hate you? i love you. she goes, you love me? i go, i mean, you seem cool. i pulled it back. i didnt want to show all my cards. just about nine of them. one of the other things that she said of note on this date is she said, you know, sometimes ill date two people at once, and that way im never let down by either person. i said, that seems like a really smart plan. like, id like to do that as well. and she said, im still kind of seeing my ex-boyfriend, john, and you can see other people too, but you have to tell me if youre seeing them. and i was like, all right, sounds like a plan. got it. break! i got to go find some more people, you know. and so a few nights later, im in another city, and i do a show, and after the show, i went out to a bar, and i ended up making out with this random girl. then a few nights later, im out to dinner with jenny, and she says, how was your trip? and i said, it was great. i did some shows, and then one night i ended up making out with this random girl. and that didnt go over very well in the conversation. i could sense that something was wrong. and i was like, but im right about that, right? like, im supposed to tell you if that happens, right? and she says, yeah, but it doesnt mean that i wont lose interest in you. and i said, thats a whole new clause! thats a twist! what is this, the romantic comedy version of the usual suspects? i said, are you still seeing john? and she said, sometimes. i said, well, dont you see the contradiction in that? and she says, yes. and it gets very quiet because we were falling in love. three weeks into my relationship with jenny, i built up the courage to ask her to go on a trip to bermuda. i wanted to show her how much more money i could put on my credit card. since i didnt have a lot left, we went to bermuda cause it was the off season. you can get these great deals online. because as it turns out, when its winter in new york, it is also winter in bermuda, and, uh jenny and i meet up at the airport, and shes late, which is a big pet peeve of mine. i fancy myself as a professional traveler. im always two hours early, i have my pocket for my ticket and my passport, and i have laceless moccasins. i never tell jokes about bombs. and and jennys late. and then we get to security, and im not making this up, she doesnt have a license or a passport. and i said, what do you mean? i go, how do you travel? and she goes, well, usually, they let me on the plane with my credit card and my work i.d. i dont like to dwell on the differences between men and women, but i just cant imagine a scenario where a man would go to the airport with no license and no passport, and they would let him on the plane. but women get a pass on things like this that i find completely bewildering. i mean, if i were in charge of al-qaeda, for example, what what i would do is i would recruit attractive women because theyre just not stopped under any circumstances. although it would be difficult to recruit them because all they have to offer are the  virgins and, you know, the women wouldnt want that, unless theyre lesbians, although theres an idea, you know. al-qaeda al-qaeda could recruit hot lesbians, although then theyd have to guarantee that the  virgins are also lesbians. i mean, what are the odds, you know? all  virgins are also lesbians, unless you think of sexuality as, like, a blank slate concept where the first person you have sex with dictates your sexual identity. like the  virgins are like, i didnt even know i was a lesbian until i had sex with that hot lesbian terrorist. and now thats all im into. i used to be into these afghani guys who are so crazy, theyd die in a fiery plane crash to have sex with me and  of my friends. but now i dont see khalid in the same way anymore. the point is, we went to bermuda, and were on the flight on the flight, and the flight attendant comes over, and she puts champagne glasses down in front of us. and she says, congratulations on your ',\n",
       "  'honeymoon. and we said, oh, no, thanks. were not on our honeymoon. and she walks away, and jenny says, thats so funny. i dont think ill ever go on a honeymoon. and i said, oh, really? and she goes, yeah. i dont think id ever want to get married in my life. and i said, oh, really? i go, me too. i said, is that based on a principle, or did you have a bad relationship? like, what was your first boyfriend like? and she told me about her first boyfriend brian. it was they were at the same bus stop when they were , and they would make out on the bus, and they were together for six years. and they you know, their relationship got deeper, and they would talk about how they were gonna get married and spend the rest of their lives together. and i said, then what? and she said, he died. he had leukemia. and i said, well, do you ever talk about this with anyone? and she says, no, i dont really like to talk about it. but these were the kinds of conversations we started having on this trip where jenny was opening up to me, and i was opening up to her. and every night wed be up till : or : in the morning, and we were so happy, we at one point, i was like, well, we should do this again. we should go on another trip. and you could get a license or a passport. jenny said, that sounds great, but i dont think id get a license or a passport cause they dont make me get one. and i was like, yeah, but its the law. you know. jenny says, yeah, i dont think ill get one cause they dont make me get one, you know. thats how i feel. thats how jenny argues things. sometimes shell just say, thats how i feel. and ill say, thats not an argument. like, were not even in an argument right now because you dont have an argument. and shell say, i just won that argument. and ill say, thats not even possible based on the definition of what an argument is. and shell say, i just won that argument, again. thats how i feel. you could see how this could be a little bit maddening, you know, uh on our final day on the trip, we got into an argument about essentially nothing. she noticed there was a basketball court at our hotel, and she said, we should play. and i was like, yeah, but not, like, a game. and she said, why? and i said, well, cause id win. and she said, no, i think i would win. i go, no. i know that id win, and i know that what im supposed to say is that the guy says, ill win, the girl says, ill win, and the guy lets her win, and then she likes him more. but i just dont have that in me. and jenny goes, you dont have to let me win. lets go out and play. and so we went out and played basketball, and i just kicked her ass. i mean, it was just like it was just like  to , you know,  to . i mean, i was having a good day, but still, i was just destroying her. and at one point, she literally said, ive never met someone whos so obsessed with the score. and i said, the score is what makes it a game! so were arguing this over lunch, and then, again, it comes up at dinner, and then were still arguing about it at : or : in the morning about essentially nothing. and she said, i dont understand why youre so obsessed with being right. i go, im not obsessed with it. i just am. i said, why do you think youre right? and she says, thats how i feel. i said, if you think im so wrong about everything, why are you even with me? and jenny says, you cant choose who you love. which is true, but it doesnt mean its good. i remember the first time i fell in love, i was in high school, and it was that first time where you fall in love, and youre just like, this is it. i found her. im  years old, and im done, you know. and her name was amanda, and she was, like, adorable and funny. and what was really exciting for me was that she was, like, a delinquent. like, i was like this play-by-the-rules school citizen, and she had been expelled from her previous school for dealing acid, which i thought was a really strong quality. like, at one point, she was like, it was totally messed up because it wasnt even me. it was this other girl, and i was framed. and i was just like, awesome. like no one would ever frame me for anything. i just i thought it was like an opposites attract situation. she wanted to know what it was like to hang out with someone in student government who writes for the newspaper. and i wanted to know what it was like to be cool. at one point, i was like, do you want to write an article for the newspaper? she goes, i dont want to write an article. i want to do things people write articles about. and i was like, good answer.\\ni find that when you fall in love, you tend to overlook certain red flags. one of them was that she would say really mean stuff to me, but then she would pull it back. shed be like, no one likes you at all. only kidding. or, like, youre like a nerd, but youre not even smart. just joking. cant choose who you love.\\nsecond red flag with amanda was that she was a liar. and i dont i dont mean that in an offensive way. like, lying was kind of like a its like a sport at the school i was at. i transferred from the all boys school to this co-ed school. there was this one guy in my class named keith robbins who was a legendary liar. youd know when he was lying cause he would lick his finger like a bookie, and he would dart his eyes from side to side. and hed go, yeah, yeah, nice. nice, you know. and he wasnt even handling money. like, i dont even know what this is about. and then he would lie about things that were sort of insignificant. hed be like, yeah, my uncles tony robbins, motivational speaker. yeah, nice, you know. and we found out that that wasnt even true. but even if that were true, that wouldnt be impressive to a bunch of high school students. but i think thats the jedi level of lying, is you lie about little stuff, and no ',\n",
       "  'one notices when youre lying about big stuff. its like banking.\\nthe final red flag with amanda was that she told me not to tell anyone that she was my girlfriend. i know. im in the future also. i think we can all see now cause were so smart, and mikes so dumb, and, uh you know, i can also see, in retrospect, thats a much bigger red flag than i perceived it to be at the time, but i was so excited she was even with me at all. and she said she had another boyfriend at home, but they were in the process of breaking up, but it was a bad time cause his parents were sick. and so i tried to be understanding of that. you know, i went along with it for a few months until she invited me to meet her parents. and i thought, well, this is the affirmation that i need. im gonna be crowned as the main boyfriend. and i drive my moms station wagon to amandas parents house, and i walk in the front door, and theres amanda, and theres her parents, and its going well. and a few hours go by, and this other guy comes over to the house, and his name is scott. im assuming hes, like, a family friend or a relative. and slowly im noticing similarities between scott and things that amanda has said about her other boyfriend. theyre both in their first year in college, and theyre competitive wrestlers, and its dawning on me that im hanging out with my girlfriends boyfriend. and its going pretty well. i mean, he he seemed like a nice guy. i could totally see what she saw in him. there was some consolation that when he would go in the other room to the kitchen or the bathroom, she would hold on to my hand, and she would say, i wish it were just you and me here. and i remember thinking, you could make that happen. the way she said it was as though she werent involved in the decision process, like, id love to, but the boys in corporate\\nwell, the day took an even stranger turn when scott suggested that we go hang out at his house. and i met his parents. it is indescribable meeting your girlfriends boyfriends parents for the first time. part of you is angry for obvious reasons, but then part of you still wants to make a good impression. you know, youre like maybe if this goes well, shell see that im good with adults in general! as a side note, his parents seemed in perfect health. at one point, his dad even said to me, how do you know amanda? and i said, were just friends from school. and i was so ashamed, and i felt so dumb. and i drove home, and i remember thinking, i am never gonna let this happen to me again. so ten months into my relationship with jenny, she invites me to meet her parents. and this was a tricky time. at this point, our relationship was intense, but casual, which is a dangerous relationship cocktail, and it was a hard thing to organize cause i was away probably five days out of the week. and so we found a sunday where i was coming back from a five-day stint in texas, which was awful cause it was in texas. and i thats thats not to say i dislike texas entirely. its such a large thing to dislike. and, uh but that week it felt like texas just disliked me, and i just kind of disliked texas back to the point where i developed a small drinking problem, which is which is very popular in texas. i was performing at a comedy club. now, comedy i love comedy clubs cause theyre sort of a high-low entertainment proposition. like, in some ways, though, theyre the last bastions of free speech and the art of spoken word, and then some of them sell dildo straws, you know. like, theres  bachelorette parties coming through on the weekends, and theyre handing out gummy penises or whatever. thats thats actually a thing. i didnt even realize that i didnt realize that that was part of the female fantasy of the penis was was the gummy quality of the penis. i feel like if i were in charge of the candification of the penis, it would be hard candy. and then if and then, if you suck it down to the gummy part, then you just sort of put that off to the side. but i but thats thats not my job. im you know, i leave that to the experts, but i just i just do the comedy part. but i was performing at this club all week, and after the late show saturday night, i was approached by this bachelorette party that had one of these sort of novelty sexual checklist things. and id been drinking all week, and, uh, i always try to be a team player, you know. so i was like, whatever i can do to help. i dont see how this could end badly. and, uh the next morning, i wake up in the my hotel room, and im hung over, and im groggy. and i roll out of bed, and i run to the airport to catch my flight. im still two hours early, and i land in new york, and i get a cab to jennys parents house. and i walk in the front door, and theres jenny, and theres her parents. and theres her other sort of ex-boyfriend, john. and he wasnt front and center. like, he was just kind of around, like, he was in the pool, like, wading and doing laps, like, that kind of thing. but i pulled jenny aside, i was like, well, whats john doing here? and she says, well, he and i arent still together, but when we were together, he became friends with my stepdad, and hes been staying here at their house the last couple weeks. and i said, you know, thats not good. i feel like that gives him the edge. jennys staring at me. and i said, what? she says, you have a hickey on your neck. and i said, i dont think thats true. and then i glance at the mirror next to me and realize that, in fact, i do have a hickey on my neck. and i say, im really sorry. and she says, where is that from? and i said, there was this bachelorette party, and i was drunk. that sentence never comes out right. i mean, theres no way to deliver that line in a way that makes you seem even okay, and we start arguing, and the argument fol',\n",
       "  'lows us all the way back to the street in front of my apartment. i didnt have a leg to stand on. i was like, well, what about john? what was he doing there? she said, you have a hickey on your neck. i said, yeah, but at least i told you the truth. and she said, eventually. and i said, eventually is better than never! and then she kneed me in the balls. i dont know if youve ever experienced this before. im sure half of you have not. uh its like being electrocuted, except you dont get to die. its like you want to die, but you cant. and theres a person in your face saying, you deserve this, which they wouldnt even do in electrocutions. i think they would deem that as inhumane.\\xa0 even in texas.\\njenny says, i think that we should just break up. you know, its not just this. i mean, youre away a lot of the time. and even when youre here, you work at night, and i work in the day. i just dont think its gonna work out. and i said, okay.\\xa0 and we were apart for about six months, and i missed her so much, but i kept resisting calling her cause i wanted to give her space. and every once in a while id get a glimmer of hope in the form of a text message from jen, irish pub, nice. and it would just say, hi. and id write back, hi. it was the smallest form of communication two people could have with one another, but i think, in some ways, kept us together. and finally, on new years, i caved in, and i called her, i said, hey, i really miss you, and i want to see you. and we got together for coffee. and we hit it off just like we used to, and we decided we would get back together. we had a great period there, you know. i took her to get a license and a passport. first, we went for her social security card, and then we took that to the d.m.v. and then we mailed all of that to the government for a passport. it was like the triple crown of identifications. jenny was wildly identifiable. one night, she was heading back from my apartment to hers, and she stops. and i said, what? and she says, i think that we should live together. and i said, no, i really dont think thats a good idea. you know, ive just decided, you know, as a principle, im not gonna get married or live with someone. its not personal. and she said, well, unless we live together, i just dont think its gonna work out cause we just dont see each other enough, and i dont think that we stand a chance. thats how i feel. so we moved in together. and one day, jenny gets an invitation to the wedding of one of her friends, and she invites me to come along. and i said, oh, no, thanks. that doesnt go over so well. she says, why? and i said, well, as you know, i dont believe in marriage, and so i dont buy into the flamboyant pageantry that goes into celebrating it. she said, well, what do you believe in? and i said, i dont know. she said, well, if you dont believe in anything, how can you not believe in marriage? and i said, well, first of all, you know, it just doesnt seem necessary. i mean, is it you know, marriage is an archaic institution invented in the middle ages based on exchanging property. i dont want to be a part of that. second of all, i dont even think we have a common cultural understanding of what marriage even is. i mean, one of me and andys friends was about to get engaged, and we were skeptical, and we said, are you sure this is the person you want to be with for the rest of your life? and he goes, yeah, i think so. and we said, well, what if she gets in a car accident, and shes disfigured? would you stay with her then? and he said, maybe! that is not an acceptable answer! third of all, if im so in love, why does it need to be written into a government contract? and im not one of these like, i dont want government up in my business kind of people! i think the government does a nice job delivering the mail and suggesting i dont eat poison, but i just dont understand why they need to be involved in my personal relationships. then finally, if marriage is religious, shouldnt i believe in the religion? ive been to more weddings of my friends where the people on the altar dont believe in the religion of the church theyve invited us to! some of them even go to classes with the priest in advance, to more elaborately lie about believing in a religion they dont believe in just to have a wedding in a fancy building! that is insane! thats how i feel! so i explain this to jenny. and jenny says, well, if you ever did want to get married, i would marry you. and i said, why? arent you listening to any of this? and jenny says, thats how i feel. at this point, it was : in the morning, wed been arguing all night, and we hadnt slept. i had to catch a flight at : a.m. out of newark airport to los angeles for a show i was doing that night. at this point, im overtired, and im angry, and im late. im stuffing my things in my roller suitcase. and i walk out of our apartment. its : a.m., that part of the morning before the earth even exists, before they program the matrix or whatever. you walk out of your apartment, part of the road isnt even there. theres a guy with a laptop going, we need a road, stat! whats the code for building, tank? you know, and i get to the airport. the news hasnt even started yet. its just an anchor looking around like, what are you up to? and i get to the kiosk, and i print up my ticket, and i bring it to the security lady, and she looks at me, and she goes, well, that aint your gate. like, i guess they changed the gate, but the way she said it was as though i had participated in the decision of changing it. i was like, i was not involved in this process. i wasnt even c.c.d. like, as though i had gone to the kiosk and been like, . like hell im flying out of . and then i photoshopped my own ticket, printed it out, and been like, this is where ',\n",
       "  'im going. you know, im not that aggressive as a traveler, so i was like, well, where is this gate? she goes, its in another terminal. you got to take a tram. she points to the tram, and i start walking my roller suitcase, and i hear her say, and you better run. like, i guess i was late at that point. so i started running. and the roller suitcase does not enjoy running. the roller suitcase was like, i dont want to run. i have wheels. and i was like, i dont want to run either, but this is what we have to do. i tell you what, when we get to the hotel, ill walk you in circles for a few hours. then i i get to the tram, and it has that feature where it says how many minutes before the next tram arrives. and it says zero minutes. i was like, perfect. thats exactly how long i want to wait. but the trams riding away. i was like, thats - minute! then it says ten minutes, and im experiencing that psychological downward spiral like, oh, great, im gonna miss my flight, and then im gonna miss every flight from now on, and im gonna miss my family reunion. and then im not gonna have a family, and then im gonna be a crack whore. and its like, all of a sudden, im a crack whore just because i miss this one flight. i can feel the cancer forming in my body in real time and\\ni get on the next tram ten minutes later, and i run to the gate, and im sweaty, and im out of breath, but im on time. and im so relieved that i sit down in a chair at the gate, and i fall asleep. and i wake up to the sound of the door shutting. i jump up, and the door is closed, and i am on the sad side of the door. the happy side has an airplane and a pilot. the sad side is me and the cinnabon lady. normally, id be very excited if it were just me and the cinnabon lady. im a big fan of pastries the size of a baby that have enough calories for a year. i think thats an effective use of time. but in this instance, i needed someone who could communicate with the people on the plane. and the cinnabon lady is not very well connected in the airline community. i was like, do you know these people? she was like, all i know is the white stuff goes on the cinnamon bun. i ran up to the giant glass window. i started pounding on the window like in a romantic comedy. i was like, drew barrymores character, come back! she didnt come back, and i missed my flight. i got on the next one they could get me on. there was a stopover in texas. you know how i feel about texas. and, uh, i get to los angeles late that night, and id missed my show. id never missed one of my shows before, and im so angry. and jennys calling me, but im not picking up the phone cause im blaming this entire day on her. i get back to my friend andys house, and i said, andy, this relationship is messing up my entire life! and andy goes, youre right. i go, i know! im right! he goes, yeah, youre right. i go, i know, im right! i got to tell her about this in the morning! i drive out of andys small road, and im t-boned. thats the culinary way of describing it. in  / seconds, im spun around, and i think im dead. no, wait, im paralyzed. and then i hear nothing. then i hear the other car skid out and drive away.  minutes later im sitting on a curb. at this point, the police have arri have arrived, as well as my friend, andy, and thats when i start crying. you know how when you drop a baby on the ground, it doesnt doesnt start crying right away because it doesnt understand the concept of dropping a baby on the ground until it sees your face? and then its like, oh, i guess i should be doing something that matches that. waah! im crying because im looking at my totaled car in front of me and realizing that, in that moment, i might have ceased to exist. like i said earlier, i dont really believe in anything, so in my mind, that would have been the end of all things id experienced in my life. every kiss or failed kiss or scrambler ride would come to a conclusion, and the officer comes over, and he says, what happened? and i said, i got hit by this car, and then i heard nothing, and then i heard the other car skid out and drive away. the officer points over to the light. the other car has made a right turn at the light and veered into this very skinny tree. i cant help but think, thats karma. thats a hit and run and hit. and then the officer puts this form in my face, and he goes, sign this. and i said, well, what does it mean? and he goes, it means youre okay and that we can leave. i was really shaken up. i was like, i dont know if im okay. and he goes, just sign it, which is a very unattractive quality. when someone just repeats a command that youve just said no to, and its unattractive, but very effective, you know. i signed it. andy takes me to the hospital just as a precaution, but we have to wait two hours cause the other driver had beat us there, and eventually, were with the doctor, and andy says to him, he goes, well, was the other guy drunk? and the doctor says, well, i cant answer that. and andy says, was he? he uses the technique we had learned earlier, and it works, you know. the doctor says, well, hes heading to jail now. and andy and i flash each other a look like the hardy boys, like, case closed. a few hours later, were back at andys house, its probably around : in the morning, and i have one of these epiphanies people sometimes have when they have near-death experiences. i say, i need to call jenny and tell her that we need to get married. and andy says, mike sleep on it. and i said, no, no, no, this makes perfect sense. and i pick up my phone, and i dial her number. and he puts his hand over the phone, and he says, mike sleep on it. he saves me. the next morning, i fly back to new york, and a few weeks later, i get a call from my rental car agency explaining that the accident report h',\n",
       "  'ad come back on the accident that i just described. and it had found me at fault and that i owed and im not making this up $, for the repairs on the other drivers mercedes s.u.v. and i was like, well, this cant be happening. i explained to the woman, i think its a misunderstanding. the other guy was clearly drunk. it was definitely not my fault. and she said, im really sorry, but unless they change the accident report, you owe this money. so i requested the accident report, and im gonna show you the actual accident report tonight. i dont know if youve ever seen one of these things before but its a little bit like homework for cops. and officer timson not so good with the homework. he consistently mixes up passenger one and passenger two, vehicle one and vehicle two. at one point, so badly that he says p- thats me started to go, but all of a sudden v- thats me also came at a high rate of speed, crashing into him. now, im pretty self-destructive as a person, but i would never crash into my own car with my own car, nor would i understand how you could do that. this part is even crazier. the other drivers statement at the scene of the accident was, i was on venice going uh, im not too sure. i was going away from the beach. i was driving. i dont know what happened. did i hurt anyone? i dont know where i was going, but i came from home. i had a sip of beer. which is really everyones favorite quantity of beer. just the one sip, right? thats what they serve these days at the home/beach/pub.\\nso all of its mine. the officer makes one key mistake. he checks the box that finds me at fault. so im like, i need to get officer timson on the phone, so we can clear up this misunderstanding. the problem is he keeps ducking my calls, and i know cause im calling two or three times a day, leaving messages, calling departments next to his department, so he knows im trying to reach him. and finally, after a month of this, i get him on the phone, and im so relieved. and i explain this misunderstanding. and he listens to me, and he says, do the right thing, and pay for the guys car. i know, and, i mean, thats what i said. i go, arent you listening to any of this? i go, and this guy was clearly drunk. i mean, he nearly killed me. inches from where he hit, and i would be dead right now. and he wants me to pay for his car? dont you see how crazy that is, just as one human being to another? and he says, do the right thing, and pay for the guys car. and he hangs up the phone. and at this point, this stops being about money, and its just about stopping a man who has no regard for people or the law. this is chinatown! so i started printing up google maps of the scene of the accident and california state driving law. im on the phone with lawyers and private investigators. theres only one lawyer who would consider the case. and he was an accident lawyer, and he said, did you have any loss of income from the accident? and i said, no, and he says, did you have any loss of income from the accident? and i said, no. this isnt about money. and he doesnt take the case, and this is when i start going completely mad.\\nim up to about : or : a.m. every night just surfing the web. i get a subscription to a site called netdetective.com, which is a great site for vigilantes who have $.. so now i know this guys name, i know where he lives, i know what he does for a living. and in my mind, it becomes like a trailer for a revenge thriller. like, jim bosworth thought he was gonna get away with this, but jim bosworth had another thing coming: mike birbiglia. i was like, im gonna track down jim bosworth. im gonna sue jim bosworth, and im gonna sue the entire los angeles police department! at this point, people stopped talking to me entirely. my friends would call me like, hey, whats going on? id be like, ill tell you whats going on! id tell them this whole story. and theyd be like, you should get a lawyer. id be like, this is way past lawyers! a lawyer wouldnt even touch this! cause he wouldnt.\\nthe only person who would talk to me at this point was jenny. one night, we were out to dinner at a restaurant, and shes talking to me, but im not listening cause im writing down ideas i have for the case on my napkin. ive drawn out a diagram of the intersection, and the angles the cars are coming from and going to and the lanes that we were in, the laws the other driver broke, and the phone numbers im gonna call that week. and im so angry, im writing over my own handwriting to the point where im ripping through the napkin. and jenny looks at me, and she says, what are you doing? and i said, well, this is my case. and she says, well, why dont you work on that in the morning? and i said, well, which part of this napkin dont you understand? jenny says, mike youre right, but its only hurting you, and im just so glad that youre alive, and i think that we should focus on that. she only has to say it once, and i give up the case, and i pay for this guys car. july , , jenny and i went to city hall and got married. i still didnt believe in the idea of marriage, and i still dont. but i believe in her, and ive given up on the idea of being right. thank you guys very much. thank you. thank you guys so much! thanks for coming here tonight and joining me. epic your email address will not be published. required fields are marked * name* e-mail* website  \\n\\n stand-up special by jim gaffigan. louis c.k. being louis c.k. without restraint. comedian drew michael is taking the stage and is holding nothing back in his first hbo stand-up special, in which he navigates his fears, anxieties and insecurities in an unconventional stand-up setting. follows drew michael and his issues with relationships, social media, and comedy as therapy. ©  scraps from the loft. all rights re'],\n",

[audience cheering and applauding] what the f*ck is going on, san francisco? thanks for coming. i appreciate it! god damn! put your phone down, f*ckface! i see you, b*tch! put your phone down! motherf*ckers. they cant use their eyes. everybodys gotta live through their goddamn phone. whoo! im high as f*ck. whoo. its strange. i wasnt sure if i was gonna do this sober. im like, ugh its not the move. not in san francisco. this is i love pot, but the people that are making edibles need to slow the f*ck down. oh, my god! what are you trying to do to people? i had a pot gummy bear the other day. i think we can all agree a gummy bear shouldnt be able to steal your soul. right? how the f*ck are these people making these things, man? theyre not consistent. thats also part of the problem. you dont know what youre getting, cause theyre not making them the same place where they make tylenol. nah, its some greasy dude with a grateful dead t-shirt on and a gray ponytail. hes got a bowl of ingredients, and he cant remember whether or not he put weed in yet. this dudes time traveling, just back and forth. he just keeps chucking weed in there until it looks like lawn trimmings. you eat it, and its not what youre looking for. its not regulated. you gotta ask questions. i asked a dude at the pot store. i go, hey, man, how strong are the gummy bears? he goes thats not a unit of measurement. hes like, el diablo. el diablo. f*ck, man. how much should i take? just the leg. just the leg? why are you selling whole bears? what the f*ck are you trying to prove, man? they just watch you leave with that bear. they go, oh, shit. they know. they know youre not gonna die. youre gonna think youre gonna die, but everybody lives. learn some shit. we learn some shit from the scary trips. see, the thing about edibles, one of the problems with it being illegal, is that a lot of us dont have a lot of information that we could use. like, theres a difference between smoking it and eating it. when you smoke it, you get thc. but when you eat it, its processed by your liver, and it produces something called -hydroxy metabolite thats five times more psychoactive than thc. and it lets you talk to dolphins. [audience laughs] this is a real moment that changed my life. i was in hawaii, and we were on a boat, and we were fishing. we were pulling these lines behind the boat, and i was so high, i was trying to figure out which way the earth was spinning. like, the boats going this way, and the suns up there. im like, um for like  minutes, im paralyzed. so, while this is all happening, these dolphins just show up. and if youve ever been around wild dolphins, theyre very trippy. its very different than you expect, because they look at you. they, like, check you out. they, like, pop out of the water and they, like, look at you like a person, not like a f*cking deer or woodchuck. they look at you like another person. granted, i was so high i thought i was gonna die, but im making eye contact with these dolphins, and i started thinking, how smart are these f*cking things? because were fishing. dolphins eat fish. but you never catch dolphins. ever. no one has ever gone fishing and accidentally caught a dolphin. and all i could think of while these dolphins were, like, hopping through the water, and looking at us and shit i was thinking, if people lived in the water, youd f*cking catch em all day. they wouldnt even have to live in the water. if cheeseburgers just floated down geary street at least once a week, a guy would be like, im taking a chance. and you see em getting yanked up to the clouds. f*ck! we lost billy! the bottom of his sneakers in a puff of cloud. you dont catch dolphins on fishhooks, man. thats weird. theyre around fishing all the time and like, b*tch. theyre f*cking smart. how smart? well, i watched a dolphin documentary, and it said they have a cerebral cortex thats % larger than a human beings. i dont know what that means, but if you say it right and dont f*ck up the words, it makes you sound smarter than you really are. i think what it means is they have big f*cking brains. but we dont think of them as being smart cause they dont do what we do. right? they dont send e-mails. they dont have houses. but if you lived in their world, you dont need anything. you dont need your fingers. no ones typing. they have a language thats so complex, we cant understand it. all the foods free. they stay where the waters warm. i started thinking, how f*cking smart are they? what if theyre exactly the same as us? what if its just some different branch of evolution? we went one way. they went the other. what if consciousness is the same? i was thinking, what if me to me is the same as me to a dolphin? the way you think of yourself when you say the word me. i was like, what if thats exactly how a dolphin feels? theyre just living life through different biology, different genetics, different life experiences. but if i lived a dolphins life, i would be him. and if he lived my life, he would be me. and then i started thinking, what if thats the case with people? what if everyone is exactly the same? were just living life through different bodies. what if thats the sec',\n",
       "  'ret of happiness? treat everyone as if its you living another life. [audience cheering and applauding] i mean and then i thought, god damn, how good is this weed im getting in california? whoo! im on a f*cking floating craft out in the middle of the ocean, talking to water people. the problem with treating everybody as if its you living another life is you wanna f*cking smack yourself. half the people you meet, you just wanna f*cking smack em. we live in the weirdest time ever. i mean, its the most awesome time ever. but its the weirdest time ever, too. were, like, that close to president trump. [man ] no. boo! no. boo! you boo, but you wont vote, you f*cks! all those bernie sanders people, yo, bernies the shit. did you vote for him? voting aint real, bro. it doesnt even work, dude. we are that close to president trump. bill cosbys a rapist, and bruce jenners a chick. were in an episode of lost. down is up and up is down! this is the type of world you get when you give kids participation trophies for getting their ass kicked in soccer games. this is the world we get! we get a goddamn nerfed-up world filled with nonsense. nobody wants to be president. nobody. i hope hillary wins. that way we can realize chicks cant do that f*cking job either. its a stupid job. its a stupid job invented back when people used to write with feathers. its dumb! its just some old-school shit that we need to get rid of. it doesnt make any sense. being president is great if theres like  people. if theres  people, you can figure out which ones the best. three hundred million people? i have three kids. i dont know where the f*ck they are right now. how is this one dude in charge of  million people? its nonsense. its so old and stupid. they make this guy sleep in this f*cking white house. if trump wins, you know his house is cooler than the white house. hes like, im not sleeping in that shitty-ass, stupid house. trumps probably got, like, a tube at home that he opens up, and a chinese girl just pops out of it, and sucks his dick and goes right back in. thats what i would do if i had that kind of money. were down to assholes! wheres elon musk when you need him? wheres the f*cking geniuses? wheres mark cuban? no. we got an old lady trying to get back at her husband for a blowjob he got in the . we got an old man who hates money. and we got a reality tv star with a plastic set of hair. you cant have a president with environmental concerns, when every time this motherf*cker does his hair, we lose a foot of ozone layer and a polar bear bursts into flames. hes got, like, a closet full of aqua net at home. you cant pretend you dont give a f*ck when you have that thing going on, dude. stop that. the white house got broken into while obama was in office. the first time in over  years that someone broke into the white house. also, the first time a girl was guarding the front door by herself. what are you trying to say, that women cant do everything men can do? exactly. thats exactly what im saying. that seems sexist, right? people say, youre sexist. no, its not sexist. heres why its not sexist. cause men cant even do everything men can do. see? theres no physical equality, folks. thats why we have the olympics. cause theres people that can do some shit that you and i cant do. one of those things is guarding the f*cking white house. i know i cant guard the white house. you know how i know? because ive met shaquille oneal and his dick is where my face is. thats not equality. thats not white privilege. listen, if the white house is experiencing a shaq attack, im the wrong dude to save the world. i did fear factor with shaq. if were holding hands, itd be like a six-year-old at the park with his dad. were barely the same thing. so, do i think women should guard the white house? no. i dont think i should, either. its not sexist to say that women cant do big physical labor things as good as giant men can. but people will tell you it is. well, im not sexist. as a matter of fact, my favorite people are all female. i have a wife and i have three daughters. theyre my favorite people in the world. but i could beat the f*ck out of all of them. okay? listen if theyre guarding the door, im getting in. i dont mean to sound cocky. but im just real confident. i could f*ck them up if i had the flu. okay? yeah, were different. were different. i could beat up my cat, too. im not proud of it. i just tell you whats up. if you wanna bet money, bet money on me. ill f*ck that cat up. most likely. cats are f*cking weird like that, man. i was petting my cat once and he bit me. i was like, whoa! are we gonna do this? what the f*ck are you doing here? i got a little nervous. got a little nervous. women can do everything men can do. this guys a piece of shit. were leaving. too much information is going in that i dont agree with! what the guy said was total bullshit. total bullshit. howd that girl get that job? ill tell you how that girl got that job. because someone let her have that job. which means, either there were a bunch of guys that were trying to f*ck her or her boss was a chick and she hated her. either ones possible. look, if there was a bunch of guys that were trying to f*ck her, that makes total sense. if theres one hot girl and shes working with five guys ',\n",
       "  'in an office, no works getting done in that office. that office is now just an audition to see which guy gets to f*ck her. each one of those guys will just slowly start to morph to figure out what this girl likes. men become like an octopus that tries to fit its way through a keyhole. theres gotta be a f*cking way. theres gotta be a f*cking way! you got this girl whos like, i could guard the front door. oh, you could definitely guard the door. no doubt. no doubt. and over time, if this woman doesnt sleep with one of these men and claim him, over time, these guys will just start morphing. and theyll just start saying ridiculous, preposterous shit. debbie wants to guard the front door. do you have a problem with that? no, i dont. as a matter of fact, i think women are amazing. plus, im vegan. and they will just they will wear patchouli. they will do what the f*ck they have to do. next thing you know, poor f*cking debbie at the front door why am i alone? [chuckles] the whole story is so bananas. and its one of my favorite stories. so im gonna give you the whole story of the break-in at the white house with no edits and no comic exaggerations. this is the real story. cause a lot of people think theres some grand conspiracy. theres some cabal of evil geniuses thats pulling the strings on everyone in america. its most likely that people are just dumb as f*ck, in all sorts of walks of life. this is the story. this is the real story about the person who broke into the white house. first of all, people are always worried, the governments checking out my e-mails, bro. the governments watching us all the time. they pulled this guy over two months before he broke into the white house. he had four handguns, two rifles and a machete with him. they didnt even watch him. he had a map. on the map was washington, and it had an x where the white house is. theyre like, youre good to go. they let him go! two months later, this motherf*cker broke into the white house. and why did he break into the white house? why do you break into the white house ever? because you want to die. you dont thats like a suicide run. thats the only reason why someone runs toward the white house. if you had to ask someone, what kind of security do you think they have at the white house? oh, dude they got snipers on every corner. they got lasers in the grass. if you get too far, they open up a door, you drop right into jail. nope. turns out they dont even have a dog. you just f*cking run. the guy who made it into the white house, he had  rounds of ammunition in his car. left that there. took a knife. thats a guy who wants to die! hes just sitting in his f*cking car going, f*ck the government! f*ck my ex-wife! and f*ck everybody! im gonna do this! f*ck you! just sprinting, oh, my god, im doing it! oh, my god, im doing it! thinking, with every step, this is gonna be the last step of my life. no, this is gonna be the last step of my life. no, this and he gets to the front door. its unlocked! he opens it. theres a girl there by herself. smacks her to the ground and just starts running through the hall. ah! hes probably going, why am i alive? hes probably thinking he was inside for minutes. for minutes, running around. he got tackled by an off-duty officer. he was probably thinking, i wanted to die. i dont want to go to f*cking jail. will somebody please shoot me? then he was probably pissed. where are my tax dollars going? what kind of security are you f*cking people running in this place? [chuckles]\\nimagine when obama found out a girl was guarding him. he was probably like, everybody, everybody, not that much diversity. i mean, what, are you playing f*cking fairy tale games here? obamas got a hard job, cause hes the first president thats ever been around while google was here. you know, he could google his own name if he gets crazy in the middle of the night. right? so, let me see what the people have to say. hed just go, obama is a [groans] im none of those f*cking things. freakin out. shit. [sighs] probably thinking, why the f*ck did i do this? i think the guy who broke into the white house and obama probably have a lot in common. in that they went for it, but they probably never really thought they were getting in there. you cant quit once youre the president. the moment obama actually got into office, like, good morning, mr. president, he was probably like, oh, no! what the f*ck did i do this for? i didnt think i was actually gonna get in. [sighs] i cant sleep. im freaking out. everybody wants to kill me. [exhales heavily] who the f*ck is guarding me? looks out in the hallway. theres a girl taking selfies. thatd be the greatest selfie of all time. a girl with her ass out, duck lips, in the background, a dudes breaking into the white house. [laughs] you know im not making this up. youve all seen this. this is recognizable. pigeon-toed is a good move cause you cant get away that good. you just, like like theres something wrong with your back. thats a recognizable pose. when did that start? cause if you look at the original pictures back when people first invented pictures, everybody just stood there looking hungry. like, if you saw a photo from the , and in the background a girl was going shes a f*cking time traveler! nobody knew that move back th',\n",

       "  'hy that doesnt make any sense. people smart enough to get to mars arent going. see, thats the dirty secret about rocket travel, ladies and gentlemen. nobody smart enough to make a rocket ever gets in one of those f*cking things. no. no, they look at each other right before the launch and they go they talk german and they get behind giant f*cking concrete bunkers. they take some square-jawed, corn-fed dude from the middle of the country, tuck a bible under that dudes arm and strap him into that giant metal dick, and shoot it off into the heavens. thats what we do. and that is what that is. that is a metal dick. its a robot dick, and were trying to f*ck the sky. we are literally trying to come people out of the tip of a metal dick onto other planets. our ultimate goal is that we get those planets pregnant, and theyre too filled up with people, and then they gotta make a new metal dick. bro, we gotta go to jupiter. then they make another one. they shoot that f*cking thing, and they fill jupiter up. we just keep filling the cosmos up with people. and we never evolve. and we never change. we stay perfect, like we are right now. whos in? youre gonna all come with me. were gonna leave here right now and go to the church of scientology right down the street, and its all gonna make sense when you find out that you are an eternal being that created reality so that you can enjoy it. i watched that hbo documentary a couple too many times. i went clear, i think. i think im clear. im back! im back now. if you havent seen [chuckles] i had to watch going clear, a scientology documentary, cause i have a neighbor whos a scientologist, and i dont even think hes gay. i dont know what the f*cks going on. [exhales heavily] but he sleeps really close to me, you know. like, my beds here, this f*cking dudes beds, like, over there. his house is i mean, if you take away the walls, hes f*cking right there. its like, what does this crazy f*ck believe? and scientology is a wonderful religion. not just because it was written by a science fiction author who wrote more fake shit than anyone thats ever walked the face of the earth. and not by a small amount. this dude never made a second draft in his f*cking life. everything was one draft of nonsense. and he wrote more of it than anybody. not in his neighborhood, not in his state, not in a year, not in a decade. more than anyone thats ever lived, ever. and scientology is still like, i dont see any red flags. i think were good. i think this is legit as f*ck. if scientology is a good religion, its because other religions get to make fun of em. its like its the one religion that even the mormons are like, b*tch, you believe what? hold on. i mean, at least we dont have video of joseph smith. theres some f*cking shitty black and white footage of l. ron hubbard with a captains outfit on. you wanna explain that? [chuckles] why does he have all those awards on? why is tom cruise wearing a gold medal the size of a dinner plate? what the f*ck is going on with you people? i watched it with my mom, and it was like first of all, scientology, they dont pay taxes. thats disturbing. theyre tax-free, which means theyre a recognized religion by the government of the united states. which means the government of the united states had to go over what they believe and went, everything seems in order. none of this shit seems like a cult. well, what the f*ck is a cult, and whats a religion? so i had to look it up. turns out i dont know who wrote this, but its a perfect definition. a cult is bullshit. its created by one person. that person knows its bullshit. in a religion, that dudes dead. so its a religion cause l. ron hubbards dead. so i guess they got it on a loophole. i watched it with my mom, and my mom was like, i cant believe anybody would fall for that. you made me go to catholic school. the f*ck are you talking about? there was a child molester dressed like a sorcerer sitting on a golden throne, and you made me call him father. slow your roll, lady. imagine if i talked to my mom like that. oh, my god. jokes, folks. just jokes. i dont have a problem with people being religious because i just think life itself is too open-ended. its too confusing. and i think were evolving. and part of our struggle in evolving is unanswered questions. we wanna seek these answers. but in the meanwhile, they just give you so much anxiety, and it f*cks with you so much. theres nothing wrong with joining a cult. i think you gotta just join a nice, friendly one. like, the mormons are a good cult. heres why. they dont get mad at anybody. like, they never kill anybody. like, heres a perfect example. matt stone and trey parker, the guys who created south park, they made a hilarious musical called the book of mormon. its fantastic. if you havent seen it, its so f*cking hilarious. but its also brutal! brutal about the mormons. you know what the mormons did? they went to see it, and they took out a full-page ad in the playbill. it said, if you enjoyed this musical and you wanna find out more about being a mormon, please visit our website. they just took it right on the chin like champs. they didnt get mad. they didnt get defensive. they didnt kill anybody. thats a good cult. they just said, what do you wanna do? we got nine wive',\n",
       "  's. shut the f*ck up! everybody just everybody, just chill. just chill. thats a good religion. thats a good cult. some cults arent that good. they get f*cking testy. you know the one. we dont have to say who. you know what im talking about. theres that one that will kill you if you draw their guy. come on, man. i cant even draw your dude? what if i draw a dude drawing your dude? no loopholes! f*ckin relax, bro. and this isnt just theoretical. people have died cause they made cartoons. before the most recent paris attacks, there was a magazine called charlie hebdo, and they were attacked, where  cartoonists were killed. eleven more were wounded, and they killed a cop, too. f*cking crazy! over cartoons! and when you when theres radical, crazy people in the world, whats interesting is the reaction to radical, crazy people and how everything just sort of kind of balances itself out when things get weird. because when these people got killed over a cartoon, the whole world was in shock. the whole world was outraged. but one of the scariest things about it was nobody wanted to print those pictures. you couldnt see em in the la times. you couldnt find them in time magazine. you had to go online and find them. it was a dark moment for free speech, because everybodys like, oh. i dont wanna get killed. i dont wanna show the pictures. it was weird, until the balance. because after they got killed and nobody wanted to print the pictures, word got back to texas where they promptly held a draw muhammad contest in garland, texas. im not making a word of this up. you can google it, and ill wait. they had a draw muhammad contest in garland, texas. two dudes showed up, started shooting at the building. they were killed almost instantly. why? because they were at a draw muhammad contest in texas. how obvious does a trap have to be before you start getting suspicious? what, are you livin in a wile e. coyote cartoon, motherf*cker? you ever go to texas? thats not santa monica, b*tch. thats a totally different kind of white people. those are some wild west people that have computers and modern guns. theyre not supposed to be there. people didnt evolve in texas. its not like they were monkeys, then they became people and they stayed in that spot. no. no, they landed on boats on the east coast. the stubborn ones stayed. the smart ones made it to california. but along the way, we lost a bunch of people. [audience laughs] and some of them just stuck around. yall go ahead. were gonna hang back here. im gonna draw the biggest dick the worlds ever seen in the sand. my wifes got the biggest titties. imma try to f*ck a snake. i think it can be done. they just stayed. they just gathered cattle, stockpiled ammo. and they all talk alike. and thats why you gotta be nervous. you gotta be nervous in places with accents, okay? its one of the reasons why i can prove that california is the best spot to live. cause all the spots that suck, they all have to sound like each other. cause i grew up in a place like that. i grew up in boston. its not that the people in boston suck, but the weather sucks. its f*cking horrible. and in the winter everybody gets in their car in the morning, and just goes, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck! f*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck! and everybodys worried about its a real possibility you might starve to death one day. you might freeze trying to walk home. [imitates boston accent] so they all talk in the same way. oh, my god. how many more months till summer? ahhh! when is this f*cking winter gonna be over? we need more firewood. [whines] they have to sound like the people around them. so if other people invade, like, we stick together. were all in this together. thats how they are in texas, too. theyre like, yall aint from around here, are ya? they have a f*cking certain way of talking. which is proof positive why california is the best spot. try making fun of a california accent. what are you gonna do? speak clear and concise? what are you gonna do? you gonna mock us? youre gonna say some shit that everybody understands? theyre not supposed to be in texas, folks. its not even a state. its a republic. they were like, man, we aint so sure about this whole united states thing. were gonna hang back. hang back, see how this plays out. they dont have any rules. they have like three pages of rule books. heres how i know this. im gonna tell you a fact, a fact about texas that will change the way you think about texas. there are more tigers in captivity in texas, in private collections, than there are in all of the wild of the world. im gonna repeat it because i know youre like, oh, the fear factor guy is just making shit up to make his jokes work. no. theres more tigers in dudes yards in texas than the rest of the f*cking planet! how is that possible? because they can. because they went through the rule book [mumbles] it dont say shit about tigers. order it up, dude. order it up, dude! one guy got a tiger, and his neighbors like, shit, i didnt know we could get tigers. and he got two tigers. and the first guy was like, i aint about to let this faggot out-tiger me. and he opened up tiger world with his oil money. were gonna need those people, folks, if the russians invade. we cant make f*cking warrior babies with those chicks in ',\n",
       "  'marin county with fake asses and rubber lips, okay? were gonna need some real warrior genes. were gonna need some women who wear non-ironic daisy dukes. they got cowboy boots with no socks and stinky feet. and they yell out, chris kyle, rest in peace, when you make em come. we need those women! if the russians come, we gotta be ready. think about the children. think about the children while i get a sip. this is super important, ladies and gentlemen. a lot of people are sleeping on [laughs] imagine if i had real points. oh, jesus christ. [audience cheering] i love you f*ckers, too, man. so excited to be here. [sighs] i have kids and i lie to them. i get high around em, too. people say you shouldnt do that, but they dont see it. they say you shouldnt be intoxicated around your children. well, im not. im high. i call it elevated. its a different thing. the people who have a problem with that, they dont understand what getting high is. like, they think youre gonna be to your kid, like, who are you? what do you think? whats the worst thing that can happen if im a little high around my kid? theyre gonna get extra hugs, and daddys going to be paranoid about objects. look out. dont go there. thats it. plus, i have cool conversations. i have a six-year-old daughter, man. theres not a lot of -year-old man and -year-old girl have in common, other than the fact shes my daughter. and so, our conversations are normally pretty boring. but when im high, im like, you know, you call that thing your baby, your doll. you call it your baby, but you know its not a baby, right? yeah, i know its not a baby. do you call it a baby because youre the youngest and you like having someone who is responsible for you? maybe. okay. thats cool. thats cool. give me a hug. i love you. [kisses] its weird, man. its weird raising little people. theres some things that i didnt expect. one of the things i didnt expect is you have to lie to them. like, you dont have to lie to them about a lot of things, but you have to lie to them about santa claus. its just one of those things, man, cause its like a community. you have to think about what your kids gonna tell other kids. because when it comes to santa claus, you dont want your kid to be one of two things. you dont want your kid to be the first kid that tells everyone that santa claus is bullshit, cause that kids an asshole. but you dont want your kid to be the last kid that figures out that santa claus is bullshit, cause that kids a moron. so you got you got a little bit of youre like, oh, no. when do we do this? when do we do this? and no one knows when to do it. you just let the kids figure it out. then theyre like, dad, what the f*ck? youre like, aw oh, i missed the boat. i missed the boat. nobody knows when to do it. nobody can be honest about it. they have little meetings and shit. and im like, when do we tell em? this lady goes, when theyre . theyre gonna be f*cking by then. i told her it was funny. she didnt believe me. im like, oh, im sorry. im off by a year. thats not as funny, but its i didnt mean it. but its this thing. they want to keep the kids in the dark. and they wanna pretend theyre the only one thats teaching the kid. this is a weird thing that people do. theyre like, i teach my kids, man. i teach my kids. eh when you see em. but unless youre some freak who homeschools your children in the forest, your kids gonna go to school. theyre gonna go to school, and theyre gonna be in a class with  other kids. the teacher only makes  bucks a year, and shes thinking about dick. thats all shes thinking about. shes thinking about getting stuffed. shes a young, fertile woman who loves kids. and shes writing on that chalkboard. and the kids all huddle up and share information. like, yeah, what did your dad tell you? your dad tell you that, yeah? my dad says santa claus is f*cking bullshit, okay? you ever go near a chimney? its that big. what the f*ck? teachers coming. play with blocks. act stupid. uh, how does this work? they play dumb. they play dumb! theyre like little prisoners, trying to figure their way out. they make little papier-mâché heads and pretend theyre napping. theyre little humans. they wanna run shit. who is these people telling us what to do? are they being straight with us, man? what the f*ck is going on? i knew the day my daughter knew that santa claus is bullshit. she came home, stared me down. she was, like, mad-dogging me. she took her book bag, and just goes [scoffs] walked right up to the chimney, looking at me. how the f*ck? dad, have you ever met santa claus? no, honey, ive never met him. but you let him in the house? and theres this moment it was a moment where a seven-year-old has you at checkmate. youre like, oh, shit. i dont know whether to high-five her or to keep lying. you wanna go, yeah, you got me. you got me. you got me. thats bullshit. no, the big bang is real, but this is bullshit. the big bang sounds even less real. the problem is, you have to be consistent. if youre teaching your kids nonsense, you gotta teach em only nonsense. you cant mix nonsense in with, like, real stuff. like, my daughter will go like, how do birds fly? i go, birds have bones that are hollow, so theyre really light. then they have feathers, which cover a large surface area. a',\n",
       "  'nd they use the hollow bones and the feathers to push down on the air. see, the air looks like its nothing, right? but its actually a bunch of gases. thats why the trees move when the wind blows. the birds can manipulate that and go through -d space. whoa! yeah, nature is crazy. yeah. how does the fat man get through the little hole? magic! christmas magic! now go to bed. im trying to f*ck your mom! go to bed! [audience laughing] jokes, folks. just jokes. cant talk like that. thats how you make strippers. you gotta be nice. theyre little, tiny people. theyre adorable. they dont know anything yet. you gotta teach em everything. you cant talk mean. [inhales sharply] kids are a lot like really f*cking stupid people in that if you get ten really stupid people in a room, the most confident one just starts running shit. they dont have to have any more information, they just have to be more confident. if you get a bunch of dummies together, theyre like, i dont know whats going on. i dont know whats going on. i f*cking do. i f*cking do. the guy doesnt have to have any extra data, he just has to be the only one thats confident. and thats what its like in school. my daughters class has this f*cking kid named debbie. and every day its, debbie says oh, f*cking debbie says. debbie says what? you dont think about that before you have kids. not only are you gonna have kids, but your kids are gonna make friends, and then you have to make friends with the f*cking parents of your kids. and some of em are crazy. my daughters like, debbie says adam and eve are the only two people in the world, and all people came from them. is that true? [sighs] and this is weird. like, you dont know what to do, right? you want to be diplomatic. you dont want to cause problems at school. but you gotta be honest. and one of the most difficult things to say to a kid is, i dont know. im like, sweetie, i dont know. i dont know if adam and eve is where people came from. but nobody knows, because no one from today is alive back then. so its not something you can measure. so its not something you can see. so we dont know. but heres what we do know. you know how some people have big ears and some people have little ears? yeah. well, some people have brains that are made out of dog shit. and they get horny, too. and what happens is, they have to find someone even dumber than them to have sex with. its like the opposite of evolution. and then they have a kid, and their kid is f*cked. their kid is f*cked! and everybody wants to pretend its a level playing field. theres no level, anywhere you look. is an eagle and a salmon level? does the salmon ever get to eat the eagle? no. the universe does not want even! it wants conflict and resolution and constant improvement. okay? im gonna shut this light out, and im gonna go f*ck your mom right in the mouth. all right? i dont say these things. i dont say any of these things! i was like, i dont know. maybe debbies right. doesnt make sense to me. how would that work? how would that work? it wouldnt work, would it? adam and eve are the only two people. they have kids. and then, where do all the other people come from? i guess the kids just start f*cking each other. is that what happens? mom f*cks the kids, or the yeah, exactly. debbies parents. they were at my house, man, for a cookout, and the dude told me the earths , years old. theyre young earth christians. theyre sweet people, by the way. before i shit on them im gonna shit on them, but before i shit on them, theyre sweet. theyre really nice people. i hug em every time i see em. theyre really kind, nice people. but they just found a part of their brain, theyre like, i have no use for this. [grunts] chucked that whole logic, discerning-reason part. this f*cking things confusing. theyre young earth christians, which means they follow the strictest interpretation of the bible possible. im like, how many people believe the earth is less than , years old? uh! i looked it up. theres a recent gallup poll that said that % of america believes the earth is less than , years old. [audience booing] heres why you shouldnt be scared. they can only measure people dumb enough to answer polls. and when you factor that in, youre talking about a really small number. cause you know what the average response is if you call people up and say, how olds the earth? number one answer is, older than your mothers pussy. and then they hang up. number two answer is, f*ck you! after that, you start throwing numbers around. and only % of those dummies were stupid enough to think the earth is , years old. thats debbies f*cking parents. so out of the people that answer polls is it even %? it might be %. only % are that f*cking stupid. and thats the % we should really be worried about. were worried about the wrong %. not that we shouldnt be worried about the really rich, greedy people. we definitely should. we should definitely worry about bankers and people who theyre just stockpiling resources. they could help the world in some really impossible ways for anybody else. but they dont. theyd rather just pile up their gold. [grunts] yeah, that % is awful. but theres another % that freaks me the f*ck out that no ones talking about. thats the % who leave comments on youtube videos. who the f*c',\n",
       "  'k are those freaks? could you imagine people talking to each other like that in real life and not beating the shit out of each other? i mean, if jesus christ himself came back from the dead and had a youtube page, the first comment would be, you aint shit without your dad, pussy. these are monsters. this is not a normal persons response. normal people dont leave comments. what a normal person does, they watch a video. they like it or they dont like it. thats it. it ends right there. but what youre dealing with is the process of racism, and child abuse, and neglect and shitty genes. and the insane clown posse is playing. they know all the words, and theyre wafting up their farts, and their cheez doodle fingers. and like, an open letter to jennifer lopez let me pause and just jerk off in my shirt real quick, here. [mimics fart] ugh dear, jennifer, dont you think its about time you dress a little more classy? what are your children gonna see when they see just f*cking think of the meanest, most biting shit thats gonna cut it. as if jennifer lopez has time in between eating diamonds and f*cking all her background dancers in a castle that she built with her ass. but you know, let me check the youtube comments to see if my self-esteems on point. oh! and you know whos dumber than them? me. cause i read their shit and i get mad. i know theyre stupid. i still get upset. f*ck! this is the world, folks. this is the world were living in. are we happy? im not sure. is this what we wanted? i dont know. [woman] no! no. [woman] no! are you sure? [woman] no! why are you doing this? what is this? what are you doing? are you fighting for freedom? whats happening? [woman ] no! are you white panthers? what is this? [man] life sucks! what are you saying? [man] life can kind of suck sometimes. life can kind of suck? maybe its how youre livin it, b*tch. life can kind of suck. its the greatest time ever to be alive. yeah, id live in the old days when you could die from crabs. it doesnt get any better than today, man. so stupid. make america great again. its as good as its ever been. what the f*ck are you saying? we have  everywhere. when has it been better? we have netflix. when has it been better? come on, man. stop. its never been better. this is as good as its ever been. its just weird. its just weird. you gotta get your shit together, b*tch. dont blame the world. god damn it. damn it, man. and listen, if youve seen any of this show, and you said, i think some of the stuff youre saying is really funny, but i sense a lot of, like, macho posturing from you. i sense a lot of, like, bullshit, tough-guy stuff. youre totally correct. and what it is is i live with all women, okay? and im becoming more of a b*tch every day of my life. and i just wanna say im not unhappy. ive never been more happy in my life. this is the happiest ive ever been. but when youre with all girls, like, you have all girls all the time, you have to make little compromises. you dont think about it while its happening. its like the rock doesnt think about the water carving a path through it, but eventually, that f*cking path is gonna get deep. and when youre with all people that are different than you, they just go, hmm they just start looking at you like little raptors testing the fence. [squawks] theyll just start poking at you. its what people do. its natural. its just what people do. if you live with people that all are on at&t and youre on verizon, theyre like, dude, look at my bars. make the switch. come on over. what are you, a f*cking democrat, dude? libertarian is where its at. wake up! join us! when youre with all girls, they just start they constantly f*ck with my manhood. its like, ill come home and some new thing is painted pink. im like, why is this pink? it looks better pink, daddy. it looks better pink, daddy. and my wifes like, i think theyre right. im like, oh i see what the f*ck is going on here. its mutiny! they just chip, chip, chip away. its like if my manhood was a mountain of marbles. every day they steal two. they just walk up to my stack you cant say shit. you cant say shit, cause its only two marbles, and youre like, i still got all these marbles. everything is gonna be okay. ill deal with this eventually. but youre not gonna deal with it. every day, two more marbles. you never get those marbles back. you see it comin. you dont do anything about it. youre like, i gotta go to sleep. all right, everybody stop crying. i gotta go to sleep. and men dont want to admit that. not me, bro. not me, bro. id rather just live in the woods by myself. what are you, a f*cking coldplay song? huh? what are you, a character in a book, you piece of shit? no ones honest. no ones honest about how much we need other people. thats why the characters that we adore so much in the movies are the people that dont need people. the people who just walk away from it all, like, wow, what a rebel! but in real life, we need people so bad that the worst shit you can do to a prisoner is put them in solitary confinement. so think about that. youre in a cement box filled with rapists and murderers. and the worst shit they can do is leave you alone. were f*cking weird. we are weird, cause what we are really is were some weird superorganism that, like, needs each other ',\n",
       "  'in some sort of strange way. but were all in denial. im kind of a loner. oh, shut the f*ck up. theres no such thing. its not real. every person in this room, me included, all of us, we are all a calculation. were all an ongoing, on-running calculation of all the interactions youve ever had with all the people that youve ever met. and you do a bunch of things that people like, and start doing more of that. youre like, ill do more of that. you find things that people dont like, youre like, ill keep that shit to myself, hmm. i dont like that feeling. hmm. thats what we do. thats what we do. its weird. we dont want to admit it. but thats who we all are. and im just telling you this because ive never been more of a b*tch. right now, i have slowly but surely bent until im in this position. this is how im riding out my days, just like this. okay, okay, okay, okay. but im also telling you right now that im not going out like bruce jenner. oh! thats right, politically correct san francisco. heres my take on this bruce jenner thing. and, you know, everybody has their own not really. this is what everybodys take is. this is the take that youre supposed to have. hes always been a woman trapped in a mans body. maybe. definitely maybe. definitely people are like that. definitely, there are people who were born in the wrong gender. and am i saying they should stay their gender? no. who gives a f*ck? you should do whatever you wanna do. you should be happy. you should be free. i dont care what you do. but its also possible that, maybe, if you live with crazy b*tches long enough, you become one. thats all im saying. i dont see this discussed. it is entirely possible. if you put a praying mantis on a leaf, it becomes the color of the leaf. why? because it wants to live. it wants to survive. it wants to be accepted by its environment. you show me a man whos lived with the kardashians for ten years who didnt come out a chick, and then well have some data, okay? cause right now, we lost a f*cking american olympian, and i want you to have some respect! were down bruce jenner. and ive got a close eye on kanye west, and i dont exactly like what im seeing. [audience applauding and cheering] look at kanye west. hes a very talented, young, heterosexual man who starts a clothing line hes clearly jealous about taylor swift, and he tweets like a coked-up stripper in the middle of the night. you dont see what im seeing? we are watching the plot of a f*cking stephen king book play out! an american athletic hero moves in with a woman whos made hundreds of millions of dollars through no way anyone can explain to anyone. he breaks up with her. she turns him into a chick. the whole world tells him hes beautiful. you tell me you dont see what im seeing? you have to say you have to say shes beautiful. shes beautiful. shes not beautiful, and neither am i. look, i look like a thumb with two thumbs. okay? you put me in a dress, id be even more disgusting. beautys unusual. theres a lot of cool shit that isnt beautiful. sixty-year-old dudes in skirts are on that list. jesus f*cking christ! what kind of games are we playing here? why are you lying to children? thats beautiful. what are my kids gonna think when they see a mountain or a rose? is that beautiful too, daddy? explain. ahhh! bang! i cant! the worlds gone f*cking bananas! what youre saying is horribly transphobic and incredibly regressive. you should be embarrassed at what youre doing. youre doing this just to get laughs at someone elses expense. maybe! or maybe bruce jenner lived with demons. maybe they waited by the bed until they knew he was in heavy rem sleep so they could assume their true form. [squawking] climb up and kick off their designer shoes to reveal black ravens claws. clutched the edge of the bed and just whispered in his ear. [snarls] [imitating demon] bruce [breathing heavily] we would like you better if you were one of us. [groaning] i cant. i cant be one of you. i was i was born a man. nonsense! [snarling] [hissing] nonsense. bruce you no longer can be held prisoner by the gender of your birth. youre free. bruce [snarling] your lips are too thin for the cover of vanity fair. huh? what? wait. wait. did you say the cover? okay. are you f*cking with me? because you know the covers always been my dream. it can be real! [snarls] it can be real. all dreams can be real through surgery. sleep. [audience cheering and applauding] thank you very much, san francisco! i had a great f*cking time with you savages! lets take a selfie. shit. we got it. putting together one of these f*cking specials is stressful as shit. i appreciate the f*ck out of all you people being here tonight. and i love you guys. thank you very much!
